PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
Starting with a focus on PC graphics, NVIDIA invented the graphics processing unit, or GPU, to solve some of the most complex problems in
computer science. We have extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of artificial intelligence, or AI. Fueled by the sustained
demand for better 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has evolved the GPU into a computer brain at the intersection of virtual
reality, or VR, high performance computing, or HPC, and AI.
The GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games and films. Today, it also simulates human
intelligence, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. Its parallel processing capabilities, supported by up to thousands of computing
cores, are essential to running deep learning algorithms. This form of AI, in which software writes itself by learning from data, can serve as the brain
of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered deep learning is being rapidly adopted by
thousands of enterprises to deliver services and features that would have been impossible with traditional coding.
NVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, libraries, systems, and services to create
unique value for the markets we serve. While the requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying
architecture leveraging our GPUs and Compute Unified Device Architecture, or CUDA, as the fundamental building blocks. The programmable
nature of our architecture allows us to support several multi-billion dollar end markets with the same underlying technology by using a variety of
software stacks developed either internally or by third party developers and partners. The large and growing number of developers for each of our
platforms strengthens our ecosystem and increases the value of our platform to our customers.
Innovation is at our core. We have invested over $15 billion in research and development since our inception, yielding inventions that are essential
to modern computing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 defined modern computer graphics and established NVIDIA as the leader in visual
computing. With our introduction of the CUDA programming model in 2006, we opened the parallel processing capabilities of the GPU for general
purpose computing. This approach significantly accelerates the performance of the most demanding applications in HPC in fields such as
aerospace, bio-science research, mechanical and fluid simulations, and energy exploration. Today, GPUs power the fastest supercomputers across
the world. In addition, the massively parallel compute architecture of our GPUs and associated software have proven to be well suited for deep
learning, an approach we believe will power the era of AI. As the laws of physics have begun to slow down Moore’s Law, we continue to deliver GPU
performance improvements ahead of Moore’s Law, giving the industry a path forward.
Gamers choose NVIDIA GPUs to enjoy immersive, increasingly cinematic virtual worlds. GPUs also help underpin the world’s fastest growing
spectator sport, eSports, which attracts hundreds of millions of viewers to watch top-quality gaming. More than 100 million people participate in
MOBA - multiplayer online battle area - games, which are powered by GPUs.
Researchers use our GPUs to accelerate a wide range of important applications, from simulating viruses to exploring the origins of the universe.
With support for more than 500 applications - including the top 15 HPC applications - NVIDIA GPUs enable some of the most promising areas of
discovery, from weather prediction to materials science and from wind tunnel simulation to genomics. In 2017, NVIDIA’s GPU computing supported
the Nobel Prize-winning discoveries in physics and chemistry.
The world’s leading cloud service providers use our GPUs to enable, accelerate or enrich the services they deliver to billions of end-users, including
search, social networking, online shopping, live video, translation, AI assistants, navigation, and cloud computing.
A rapidly growing number of enterprises and startups use our GPUs to facilitate deep learning that meets, and in several cases surpasses, human
perception, in fields ranging from radiology to precision agriculture. For example, the transportation industry is turning to our GPUs and AI to enable
autonomous vehicles, or AVs, with more than 320 companies and organizations working with NVIDIA’s DRIVE platform.
Professional designers use our GPUs to create visual effects in movies and design products ranging from soft drink bottles to commercial aircraft.
While our GPU and CUDA architecture is unified, our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro
for designers; Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brand
integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, and incorporates GPUs and multi-

Our GPU computing solutions enhance productivity and introduce new capabilities for critical parts of the workflow for such major industries as
automotive, media and entertainment, architectural engineering, oil and gas, and medical imaging.
Designers who build the products we use every day need the images that they view digitally to mirror reality. This requires simulating the physical
behavior of light and materials, or physically-based rendering, an emerging trend in professional design. Our DesignWorks software delivers this to
designers and enables an architect designing a building with a computer-aided design package to interact with the model in real time, view it in
greater detail, and generate photorealistic renderings for the client. It also allows an automotive designer to create a highly realistic 3D image of a
car, which can be viewed from all angles, reducing reliance on costly, time-consuming full-scale clay models.
Just as VR is becoming more important in gaming, it is also being incorporated in a growing number of enterprise applications, including within
medicine, architecture, product design, and retail. Virtual car showrooms, surgical training, architectural walkthroughs, and bringing historical scenes
to life all deploy this technology, powered by our GPUs.
Visual computing is vital to productivity in many environments, including design and manufacturing and digital content creation. Design and
manufacturing includes computer-aided design, architectural design, consumer-products manufacturing, medical instrumentation, and aerospace.
Digital content creation includes professional video editing and post production, special effects for films, and broadcast-television graphics.
Our brand for this market is Quadro for workstations. Quadro GPUs enhance the productivity of designers by improving performance and adding
functionality, such as photorealistic rendering, high color fidelity, and advanced scalable display capabilities. During fiscal year 2018, we also
introduced Holodeck, a photorealistic, collaborative VR environment that allows creators and designers to import high-fidelity, full-resolution models
into VR and leverage physics simulation to make design decisions easier and faster.
Datacenter
The NVIDIA accelerated computing platform addresses AI, in which systems learn using unstructured data, and HPC, in which it speeds work
toward reaching answers for more narrowly defined problems. The platform consists of our energy efficient GPUs, our CUDA programming
language, specific libraries such as cuDNN and TensorRT, and innovations such as NVLink, which enables application scalability across multiple
GPUs.
Deep learning is a new AI computer model where neural networks are trained to recognize patterns from massive amounts of data in the form of
images, sounds and text - in some instances better than humans. It also greatly increases the performance and power efficiency of high-
performance computers and datacenter systems. GPUs excel at parallel workloads, speeding applications by 10-75x compared with CPUs, reducing
each of the many data training iterations from weeks to days. In the past year alone, GPUs have sped up training of deep neural networks for AI by
as much as 12x.
We are engaged with thousands of organizations working on AI in a multitude of industries, from automating tasks such as reading medical images,
to enabling fraud detection in financial services, to optimizing oil exploration and drilling. These organizations include the world’s leading cloud
services companies such as Amazon, Baidu, and Facebook, which are infusing AI in applications that enable highly accurate voice recognition and
real-time translation; enterprises that are increasingly turning to AI to improve products and services; and startups seeking to implement AI in
disruptive ways across multiple industries. We have partnered with industry leaders such as IBM, Microsoft, and SAP to bring AI to enterprise users.
We also have partnerships in healthcare and manufacturing, among others, to accelerate the adoption of AI.
To enable deep learning, we provide a family of GPUs designed to speed up training and inferencing of neural networks. They are available in
industry standard servers from every major computer maker worldwide, including Cisco, Dell, HP, Inspur, and Lenovo; from every major cloud

GPUs also increase the speed of applications used in such fields as aerospace, bio-science research, mechanical and fluid simulations, and energy
exploration. They have already had a significant impact on scientific discovery, including improving heart surgery, mapping human genome folds,
seismic modeling, and weather simulations.
Accelerated computing is recognized as the path forward for computing amid the slowing of Moore’s Law. The proportion of supercomputers utilizing
accelerators has grown sharply over the past five years, now accounting for a significant proportion of both the total systems on the TOP500 list,
which ranks the 500 most powerful commercially available computer systems, and the list’s total floating-point operations per second. Tesla GPU
accelerators power many of the world’s fastest supercomputers, including the U.S. Department of Energy’s next generation of supercomputers,
Summit and Sierra, at Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, and Japan’s ABCI supercomputer.
We also serve the datacenter market with GRID for virtualized graphics. GRID makes it possible to run graphics-intensive applications remotely on a
server in the datacenter. Applications include accelerating virtual desktop infrastructures and delivering graphics-intensive applications from the
cloud for industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, and educational institutions, among others.
Automotive
NVIDIA’s Automotive market is comprised of infotainment solutions, advanced driver assistance systems, and AV opportunities. Leveraging our
technology leadership in AI and building on its long-standing automotive relationships, we are delivering a full solution for the AV market under the
DRIVE brand. NVIDIA has demonstrated multiple applications of AI within the car. AI can drive the car itself as a pilot, in either partial or fully
autonomous mode. AI can also be a co-pilot, assisting the human driver in creating a safer driving experience.
NVIDIA is working with over 320 automakers, tier-one suppliers, automotive research institutions, HD mapping companies, and startups to develop
and deploy AI systems for self-driving vehicles. Our unified AI computing architecture starts with mapping and training deep neural networks using
our Tesla GPUs, and then running them within the vehicle on the NVIDIA DRIVE AI car computing platform. This end-to-end approach leverages
NVIDIA DriveWorks software and allows cars to receive over-the-air updates to add new features and capabilities throughout the life of a vehicle.
DRIVE PX can understand in real-time what's happening around the vehicle, precisely locate itself on an HD map, and plan a safe path forward.
This advanced self-driving car platform combines deep learning, sensor fusion, and surround vision to change the driving experience. Our DRIVE
PX platform scales from a palm-sized, energy-efficient module for AutoCruise automated highway-driving capabilities to a configuration with multiple
systems aimed at enabling driverless cars. A new single-processor configuration of DRIVE PX enables vehicles to use deep neural networks to
process data from multiple cameras and sensors.
Business Strategies
NVIDIA’s key strategies that shape our overall business approach include:
Advancing the GPU computing platform. The massive parallel processing capabilities of NVIDIA GPUs can solve complex problems in
significantly less time and with lower power consumption than alternative computational approaches. Indeed, GPUs can help solve problems that
were previously deemed unsolvable. We work to deliver continued GPU performance leaps that outpace Moore’s Law by leveraging innovation
across the architecture, chip design, system, and software layers. Our strategy is to target markets where GPUs deliver order-of-magnitude
performance advantages relative to legacy approaches. Our target markets so far include gaming, professional visualization, datacenter, and
automotive. While the requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs
and CUDA as the fundamental building blocks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to make leveraged investments in R&D: we
can support several multi-billion dollar end markets with the same underlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either
internally or by third party developers and partners. We utilize this platform approach in each of our target markets.
Extending our technology and platform leadership in AI. Deep learning is fundamental to the evolution of AI. We provide a complete, end-to-end
GPU computing platform for deep learning, addressing both training and inferencing. This includes GPUs, our CUDA programming language,
algorithms, libraries, and system software. GPUs are uniquely suited to AI, and we will continue to add AI-specific features to our GPU architecture
to further extend our leadership position. Our AI technology leadership is reinforced by our large and expanding ecosystem in a virtuous cycle. Our
GPU platforms are available from virtually every major server maker and cloud service provider, as well as on our own AI supercomputer. There are
over 700,000 CUDA developers worldwide who write programs using CUDA to help deploy our technology in our target markets. We evangelize AI
through partnerships with hundreds of universities and more than 2,000 startups through our Inception program. Additionally, our Deep Learning
Institute provides instruction on the latest techniques on how to
7
Table of Contents
design, train, and deploy neural network-powered machine learning in applications. It covers widely used open-source frameworks and NVIDIA’s
latest GPU-accelerated deep learning platforms.
Extending our technology and platform leadership in visual computing. We believe that visual computing is fundamental to the continued
expansion and evolution of computing. We apply our research and development resources to extending our leadership in visual computing, enabling
us to enhance the user experience for consumer entertainment and professional visualization applications. Our technologies are instrumental in
driving gaming forward, as developers leverage our libraries and algorithms to create near-cinematic and VR experiences. Our close collaboration
with game developers allows us to deliver an optimized gaming experience on our GeForce platform. Our GeForce Experience gaming application
further enhances each gamer’s experience by optimizing their PC’s settings, as well as enabling the recording and sharing of gameplay. We also
enable interactive graphics applications - such as games, movie and photo editing and design software - to be accessed by almost any device,
almost anywhere, through our cloud platforms such as GRID for enterprise and GeForce NOW for gaming.
Advancing the leading autonomous vehicle platform. We believe the advent of AV will soon revolutionize the transportation industry. In our view,
AI is the key technology enabler of this opportunity, as the algorithms required for autonomous driving - such as perception, localization, and
planning - are too complex for legacy hand-coded approaches, and will run on multiple trained neural networks instead. Therefore, we have
provided a full functionally safe AI-based hardware and software solution for the AV market under the DRIVE brand, which we are bringing to market
through our partnerships with automotive original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, tier-1 suppliers, and start-ups. Our AV solution also includes
the GPU-based hardware required to train the neural networks before their in-vehicle deployment, as well as to re-simulate their operation prior to
any over-the-air software updates. We believe our comprehensive, top-to-bottom and end-to-end approach will enable the transportation industry to
solve the complex problems arising from the shift to autonomous driving.
Leveraging our intellectual property. We believe our intellectual property is a valuable asset that can be accessed by our customers and partners
through licenses and development agreements when they desire to build such capabilities directly into their own products, or have us do so through
a custom development. Such license and development arrangements can further enhance the reach of our technology.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales strategy involves working with end customers and various industry ecosystems through our partner network. Our worldwide sales and
marketing strategy is key to achieving our objective of providing markets with our high-performance and efficient GPU and embedded system-on-a-
chip, or SOC, platforms. Our sales and marketing teams, located across our global markets, work closely with end customers in each industry. Our
partner network incorporates each industry's respective OEMs, original device manufacturers, or ODMs, system builders, add-in board
manufacturers, or AIBs, retailers/distributors, internet and cloud service providers, automotive manufacturers and tier-1 automotive suppliers,
mapping companies, start-ups, and other ecosystem participants.
Members of our sales team have technical expertise and product and industry knowledge. We also employ a team of application engineers to assist
our partner network in designing, testing, and qualifying system designs that incorporate our platforms. We believe that the depth and quality of our
design support are key to improving our partner network’s time-to-market, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction, and fostering
relationships that encourage our end customers and partner network to use the next generation of our products within each platform.
To encourage the development of applications optimized for our GPUs, we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software
development community. Engineering and marketing personnel engage with key software developers to promote and discuss our platforms, as well
as to ascertain individual product requirements and solve technical problems. Our developer program makes our products available to developers
prior to launch in order to encourage the development of AI frameworks, SDKs, and APIs for software applications and game titles that are
optimized for our platforms. Our Deep Learning Institute provides in-person and online training for developers in industries and organizations around
the world to build AI and accelerated computing applications that leverage our GPU and CUDA platforms. We now have over 700,000 registered
developers across our platforms, including accelerated computing, gaming, deep learning, autonomous machines, and others.
As NVIDIA’s business has evolved from a focus primarily on gaming products to broader markets, and from chips to platforms and complete
systems, so, too, have our avenues to market. Thus, in addition to sales to customers in our partner network, certain of our platforms are also sold
through e-tail channels, or direct to cloud service providers and enterprise customers.
Backlog
Our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders. The quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment
schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers' requirements and
8
Table of Contents
in manufacturing availability. Our industry is characterized by relatively short lead time orders and delivery schedules, thus, we believe that only a
small portion of our backlog is non-cancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable portion is not significant.
Seasonality
Our GPU and Tegra processor platforms serve many markets from consumer PC gaming to enterprise workstations to government and cloud
service provider datacenters, although a majority of our revenue stems from the consumer industry. Our consumer products have typically seen
stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. However, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue.
Manufacturing
We do not directly manufacture semiconductors used for our products. Instead, we utilize a fabless manufacturing strategy, whereby we employ
world-class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. This strategy uses
the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication,
assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with
owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products, such as
substrates and a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of the majority of the raw materials used in the production of
our products. As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing, and customer support.
We utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, to produce
our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., BYD Auto Co. Ltd.,
Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., JSI Logistics Ltd., King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd., and Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd. to
perform assembly, testing, and packaging of most of our products and platforms. We purchase substrates from IbidenCo. Ltd., Nanya Technology
Corporation, and Unimicron Technology Corporation, and memory from Micron Technology, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., and SK Hynix.
We typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance, and then ship the semiconductors to
contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs, distributors, motherboard and AIB customers from our third-party warehouse in Hong Kong. Generally,
these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications, and then ship our products to retailers, system
builders, or OEMs as motherboard and AIB solutions.
We also utilize industry-leading contract manufacturers, or CMs, such as BYD and Quanta Computer, to manufacture some of our products for sale
directly to end customers. In those cases, key elements such as the GPU, SOC and memory are often consigned by us to the CMs, who are
responsible for the procurement of other components used in the production process.
Working Capital
We focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other working-capital-related items. We manage inventories by communicating
with our customers and partners and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a platform-by-platform basis. We then place
manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand. We generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because
the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules. A substantial amount of our inventories is
maintained as semi-finished products that can be leveraged across a wide range of our processors to balance our customer demands.
Our existing cash and marketable securities balances increased by 5% to $7.11 billion at the end of fiscal year 2018 compared with the end of fiscal
year 2017 .
Research and Development
We believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading accelerated computing technology is essential
to our future success. Our research and development strategy is focused on a unified hardware and software architecture. Our products take years
to design and bring to market, and we concurrently develop multiple generations of our architecture. Our research and development efforts include
software engineering, including efforts related to the development of our CUDA platform, hardware engineering related to our GPUs, Tegra
processors, and systems, very large scale integration design engineering, process engineering, architecture and algorithms.

Table of Contents
As of January 28, 2018 , we had 8,191 full-time employees engaged in research and development. During fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , we
incurred research and development expenses of $1.80 billion , $1.46 billion , and $ 1.33 billion , respectively.
Competition
The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. We believe
that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution
channels, software support, conformity to industry standard Application Programming Interfaces, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and
total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that
customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at
competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly
than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or
alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.
A significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, embedded SOCs, and accelerated and AI
computing processor products. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do
and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes.
Our current competitors include:
• suppliers or licensors of discrete and integrated GPUs and accelerated computing solutions, including chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics,
or HPC or accelerated computing functionality as part of their solutions or platforms, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, ARM
Holdings plc, Imagination Technologies Group plc, Intel Corporation, or Intel, and Xilinx, Inc.; and
• suppliers of SOC products that are embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and smart devices such as televisions, monitors, set-
top boxes, and gaming devices, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom Ltd., Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics
Corporation, Samsung, and Texas Instruments Incorporated.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and licensing
arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from
April 2018 to January 2037. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents
and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on
international treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products
are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same
extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We
continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:
• the location in which our products are manufactured;
• our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;
• the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and
• the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and regions.
We have also licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in some of our products and for defensive reasons, and expect to continue to
enter into such license agreements.
Employees
As of January 28, 2018 , we had 11,528 employees, 8,191 of whom were engaged in research and development and 3,337 of whom were engaged
in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative positions.
Environmental Regulatory Compliance
To date, we have not incurred significant expenses related to environmental regulatory compliance matters.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
In evaluating NVIDIA and our business, the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form
10-K. Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves risks including, but not limited to, the risks
described below. Any one of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation, which could cause
our stock price to decline, and you may lose all or a part of your investment. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or
that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.
Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Partners
If we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets, or identify new products, services or technologies, our revenue and financial results
may be adversely impacted.
We have created GPU-based visual and accelerated computing platforms that address four large markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization,
Datacenter, and Automotive. These markets often experience rapid technological change, changes in customer requirements, new product
introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards. Our success depends on our ability to identify these emerging industry changes
and to develop new (or enhance our existing) products, services and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets. Such activities
may require considerable technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments. We currently devote significant resources to the
development of technologies and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history, such as the automotive and datacenter
markets, which presents additional risks to our business. We must also continue to develop the infrastructure needed to appropriately scale our
business in these areas, including customer service and customer support. We also must meet customer safety and compliance standards, which
are subject to change. Additionally, we continue to make considerable investments in research and development, which may not produce significant
revenue for several years, if at all. If our investments are unsuccessful and we fail to develop new products, services and technologies, or if we
focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, our business, revenue, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely
affected. We cannot assure you that our strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers,
partners and ultimately, our shareholders. If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends, or if we
do not appropriately adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve, in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities, our business will
be harmed.
Competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue.
Our target markets remain extremely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product and/or service
offerings, industry standards continue to evolve, customer needs change and new competitors enter these markets. Our competitors’ products,
services and technologies may be less costly, or may offer superior functionality or better features, than ours, which may result, among other things,
in lower than expected selling prices for our products. In addition, some of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities, have
longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive intellectual property, or IP, portfolios and patent protections, and greater
financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon
opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, quickly transition their products, including semiconductor products, to increasingly
smaller line width geometries, and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials, which could harm our business. If we are unable to
successfully compete in our target markets, respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this
competitive environment, including in significant international markets such as China, demand for our products, services and technologies could
decrease, which would cause our revenue to decline and cause our results of operations to suffer. In addition, the competitive landscape in our
target markets has changed and may continue to evolve due to a trend toward consolidation, which could lead to fewer customers, partners, or
suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.

System security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue and
increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation.
Security breaches, computer malware and cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years. These threats are
constantly evolving, making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures. These
attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected to occur in the future. Experienced computer programmers, hackers and
employees may penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information, or that of our employees or third
parties. These attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These hackers may also develop and deploy viruses, worms and other
malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products, including consumer and automotive products,
where we utilize over-the-air updates to improve functionality over time. For portions of our IT infrastructure, including business management and
communication software products, we rely on products and services provided by third parties. These providers may also experience breaches and
attacks to their products which may impact our systems. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, such as actions by an
employee with access to our systems. To defend against security threats, both to our internal systems and those of our customers, we must
continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which may result in increased expenses.
Actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary
information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our partners, our customers or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk
of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability, paying damages, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our
brand and reputation or other harm to our business. Our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may
not be successful. We may experience interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. Such disruptions could
adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these
disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.
If our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects, our reputation could be
damaged, and we could lose market share.
Our products are complex and may contain defects or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any
number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. These risks may increase as our products are introduced
into new devices, markets, technologies and applications, including into the automotive market, or as new versions are released. Some errors in our
products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used by customers or the end users of such product.
Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our customers or end users to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who
develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. Failure of our products to
perform to specifications, or other product defects, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers, the end product in
which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect
may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs, write off the value of related inventory, cause us to lose market
share, and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. In addition, an error
or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve
market acceptance or loss of design wins, harm our relationships with customers and partners and harm consumers’ perceptions of our brand. Also,
we may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including costs to repair or replace products in the field. A product recall,
including automotive recalls or a recall due to a bug in our products, or a significant number of product returns could be expensive, damage our
reputation, harm our ability to attract new customers, result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us, such as
product liability suits. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts
of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage
may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.
We depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test and/or package our products, which reduces our control
over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our
business.
We do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our GPUs and Tegra processors and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. Instead,
we are dependent on industry-leading foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co.
Ltd., to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. Similarly, we do not directly assemble, test or
package our products, but instead rely on
13
Table of Contents
independent subcontractors. We do not have long-term commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors. As a result, we face several
significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross
margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:
• a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices due to supply constraints;
• a failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate or any manufacturing or test capacity for our products;
• a failure to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality, leading-edge process technologies, including transitions to smaller
geometry process technologies such as 16nm FinFET, and memory designs such as CoWoS, needed to manufacture our products profitably
or on a timely basis;
• loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing
volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier;
• a lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality; and
• delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries
prioritize our competitors’ orders over our orders or otherwise.
In addition, low manufacturing yields could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand, increase manufacturing costs, harm
customer or partner relationships, and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. Manufacturing
yields for our products are a function of product design, which is developed largely by us, and process technology, which typically is proprietary to
the foundry. Low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure. We do not know whether a yield problem will exist until
our design is actually manufactured by the foundry. As a result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and
require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem.
We also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new products or product
enhancements, and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner. In the past, we have experienced delays in the
introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex
features and functionalities of our products. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater
functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. If we miss design cycles or lose design wins
due to the unavailability of such software development tools, we could lose market share and our revenues could decline.
If we fail to achieve design wins for our products, our business will be harmed.
For our products that we do not sell directly to consumers, achieving design wins is an important success factor. Achieving design wins may involve
a lengthy process in pursuit of a customer opportunity and depend on our ability to anticipate features and functionality that customers and
consumers will demand. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a
particular product. This could result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive bid selection processes.
Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and
software developers. Further, if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards, including safety standards, our customers
may not incorporate our products into their design strategies. Winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will
realize as much revenue as anticipated, if any.
Business disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs.
Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, outages at cloud service
providers, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, medical epidemics or
pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic events or climate change. The occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm
our business and result in significant losses, a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses. Any of these business disruptions
could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. Our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our
research and development activities, are located in California, and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in Asia,
near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. In addition, a majority of our current datacenter capacity is located in California, making our
operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. The manufacture of product
components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan,
China and Korea. Geopolitical change or changes in government regulations and policies in the U.S. or abroad also may result in changing
regulatory requirements,
14
Table of Contents
trade policies, and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. Catastrophic
events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems
and personnel. Our operations could be harmed if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason,
including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business,
labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers and our
general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a
major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affects us or the third-party systems on which we rely, our business could be harmed as a
result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations.
If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed.
We manufacture our GPUs and Tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand and requirements. In order to have shorter shipment
lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, or may
build inventory anticipating demand for a product that does not materialize. In estimating demand, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may
prove to be incorrect. Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include:
• changes in business and economic conditions, including downturns in our target markets and/or overall economy;
• changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit market;
• a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products;
• a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;
• our introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products;
• less demand than expected for newly-introduced products; or
• increased competition, including competitive pricing actions.
The cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which could adversely affect our gross
margins. In addition, because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter, we may not be able to reduce our
inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals. We could be required to write-down our
inventory to the lower of cost or market or write-off excess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly
forecast product demand, any of which could harm our financial results.
Conversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to
increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers' orders on a timely basis. We may also face supply
constraints caused by natural disasters or other events. In such cases, even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand,
we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner. If we fail to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer
relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged.
We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations, which may harm our business.
We conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the United States. Our semiconductor wafers are
manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States and Other Americas. We also generate a
significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the United States and Other Americas. Revenue from sales outside of the United States and
Other Americas accounted for 79% , 80%, and 79% of total revenue for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Additionally, as of January
28, 2018, approximately 47% of our employees were located outside of the United States. The global nature of our business subjects us to a
number of risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations,
including:
• international economic and political conditions, such as political tensions between countries in which we do business;
• unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including changes in tax laws;
• differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices;
• local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited
from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anticorruption laws and regulations;
• exporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions, including deemed export restrictions, tariffs, quotas and other trade
barriers and restrictions;
15
Table of Contents
• disruptions of capital and trading markets and currency fluctuations; and
• increased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations, such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and pollution limits.
If our sales outside of the United States and Other Americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may be
negatively impacted.
If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, we may not be able to execute our business strategy
effectively.
To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees. The
market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. In particular, hiring qualified executives, scientists, engineers,
technical staff and research and development personnel is critical to our business. Additionally, changes in immigration and work permit laws and
regulations or the administration or interpretation of such laws or regulations could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees.
If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and
services may be adversely affected. Additionally, competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based
compensation. The interpretation and application of employment related laws to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and
less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure
effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.
We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments and we may
not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell
our products.
We have in the past acquired and invested in, and may continue to acquire and invest in, other businesses that offer products, services and
technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products, strategic objectives and business. The risks associated with past or
future acquisitions or investments could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products, and ultimately could have
a negative impact on our growth or our financial results. Given that our resources are limited, our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity
costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us
achieve our strategic objectives. Additional risks related to acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:
• difficulty in combining the technology, products, operations or workforce of the acquired business with our business;
• diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention;
• assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;
• difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return, if at all;
• difficulty in obtaining regulatory, other approvals or financing;
• failure and costs associated with the failure to consummate a proposed acquisition or other strategic investment;
• legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;
• uncertainties and time needed to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;
• the need to later divest acquired assets if an acquisition does not meet our expectations;
• potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the acquired assets or company; and
• impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s, employees, vendors and customers, as a result of our acquisition or investment.
Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Common Stock and Other Matters
Actions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are
unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.
We have in the past, currently are, and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or
other intellectual property rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement. An
unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages, invalidation of a patent or family of patents,
indemnification of customers, payment of lost profits, or, when it has been sought, injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe
the IP rights of others,
16
Table of Contents
regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the
efforts and attention of management and technical personnel.
We may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights. Such proceedings may increase our
operating expenses, which could negatively impact our operating results. Further, we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of
litigation. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s patent or intellectual property, we or one of
our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s patent or other intellectual property rights. However, we may not be able to obtain
licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a
third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or
discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments, or cross license our
technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore,
the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results.
Our success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks,
trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements, and the laws of the countries in which we operate to
protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect
our intellectual property rights, and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights that are valuable
to our business. The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of
the United States. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or
publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our
products; as a result, the value of our investment in research and development, product development, and marketing could be reduced. We
continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies, but cannot be certain whether
our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether we will be able to enforce such protections.
Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations
of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.
Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors. Therefore, investors should not
rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance.
Factors, other than those described elsewhere in these risk factors, that could affect our results of operations in the future include, but are not limited
to:
• our ability to achieve volume production of our next-generation products;
• our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;
• fluctuations in the demand for our products related to cryptocurrencies;
• changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our partners’ products;
• our ability to cover the manufacturing and design costs of our products through competitive pricing;
• our ability to comply and continue to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations;
• product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues;
• our ability to secure appropriate safety certifications and meet industry safety standards;
• supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our products
• inventory write-downs;
• our ability to continue generating revenue from our partner network, including by generating sales within our partner network and ensuring our
products are incorporated into our partners product ecosystems, and our partner network’s ability to sell products that incorporate our GPUs
and Tegra processors;
• the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments to us, and our ability to obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit
extended to these customers;
• customer bad debt write-offs;
• any unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities;
• unexpected costs related to our ownership of real property;
17
Table of Contents
• changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards; and
• general macroeconomic or industry events and factors affecting the overall market and our target markets.
Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results. Any such failure to meet our
expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility.
Privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter current and potential users from using our
products and services, result in liability, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings.
Our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security
laws and regulations. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or
other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss, or misuse
of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business or by one of our partners could result in significantly increased
security costs, damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased costs related to defending legal
claims.
Worldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection, which continue to
evolve and apply to our business. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which requires
companies to meet new requirements beginning in May 2018 regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the ability of
persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to
4% of worldwide revenue. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and
elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid, and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, we may
be ordered to change our data practices and/or be fined. Complying with these changing laws has caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur
substantial costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, failure to comply with existing or new rules
may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity.
We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax
rates.
As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net
worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax
liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our
worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Further, changes in United States federal, and state or international tax laws applicable
to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows, as we experienced in fiscal
year 2018 with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA.
Our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, changes in our business or statutory rates, changes in
jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in available tax credits, the resolution of issues arising from tax
audits, changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in
expenses not deductible for tax purposes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances,
changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation and the recognition of excess tax
benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period in which they occur, the impact of accounting for business combinations,
shifts in the amount of earnings in the United States compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax, changes in
our international organization, as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits. Any changes in our effective tax rate may
reduce our net income.
Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.
We have in the past and may, from time to time, face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and investigations involving
shareholder, consumer, competition and other issues relating to our business on a global basis. In the past, securities class action litigation has
often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities and we have been in the past, and may be in
the future, the target of securities litigation. The laws and regulations our business is subject to are complex, and change frequently. We may be
required to incur significant expense to comply with, or remedy violations of, these regulations. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently
uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain
products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing
18
Table of Contents
of patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position,
and overall trends. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations.
Delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft Corporation could delay or
prevent a change in control.
Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent
a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the
person becomes an interested shareholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders. In addition, our certificate of
incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock.
These provisions include the following:
• the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval;
• the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent;
• advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals;
• the ability of our Board of Directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval;
• a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;
• the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders; and
• the ability of our Board of Directors to make, amend or repeal our bylaws.
On March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain
technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares
equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the
stock. The Microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA. These provisions could
also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate
actions they desire.

Dividend Policy
In November 2017, we increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.14 per share, or $0.56 on an annual basis, to $0.15 per share, or $0.60 on an
annual basis. In fiscal years 2018 and 2017 , we paid $341 million and $261 million , respectively, in cash dividends to our common shareholders.
Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under the program are subject to continued capital availability and our Board
of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our
shareholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements of NVIDIA applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends. In
calendar year 2017 , based upon our earnings and profits, 100% of our dividend payments were considered to be ordinary dividends. It is possible
that a portion of our dividend payments in future calendar years may be considered a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock. In November 2016, the Board authorized an additional $2.00
billion under our repurchase program and extended it through December 2020.
Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 251 million shares under our share repurchase
program for a total cost of $5.5 billion through January 28, 2018 . All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock.
As of January 28, 2018 , we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $1.82
billion through December 2020. For fiscal year 2019, we intend to return $1.25 billion to our shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends
and share repurchases.
The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be
made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market
conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common
stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion. As part of our share repurchase program, we may enter into structured
share repurchase transactions with financial institutions. These agreements generally require that we make an up-front payment in exchange for the
right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement, and a potential incremental number of shares of
our common stock, within a pre-determined range, at the end of the term of the agreement.

Transactions Related to our Convertible Notes and Note Hedges
During fiscal year 2018 , we issued an aggregate of 33 million shares of our common stock upon settlement of $812 million in principal amount of
Convertible Notes submitted for conversion. In connection with these conversions, we exercised a portion of our Note Hedges to acquire an equal
number of shares of our common stock. The counterparty to the Note Hedges may be deemed an “affiliated purchaser” and may have purchased
the shares of our common stock deliverable to us upon this exercise of our option. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the Convertible Notes and the Note Hedges.
Restricted Stock Unit Share Withholding
We also withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted
stock unit awards under our employee equity incentive program. During fiscal year 2018 , we withheld approximately 4 million shares at a total cost
of $612 million through net share settlements. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion regarding our equity incentive plans.

Overview
Our Company and Our Businesses
Starting with a focus on PC graphics, NVIDIA invented the GPU to solve some of the most complex problems in computer science. We have
extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI. Fueled by the sustained demand for better 3D graphics and the scale of the
gaming market, NVIDIA has evolved the GPU into a computer brain at the intersection of VR, HPC, and AI.
Our two reportable segments - GPU and Tegra Processor - are based on a single underlying architecture. From our proprietary processors, we have
created platforms that address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter, and Automotive.
While our GPU and CUDA architecture is unified, our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro
for designers; Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brand
integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, and incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots,
drones, and cars, as well as for consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices.
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.
Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges
Fiscal Year 2018 Summary
Year Ended
January 28, January 29,
2018 2017 Change
($ in millions, except per share data)
Revenue $ 9,714 $ 6,910 Up 41%
Gross margin 59.9% 58.8% Up 110 bps
Operating expenses $ 2,612 $ 2,129 Up 23%
Income from operations $ 3,210 $ 1,934 Up 66%
Net income $ 3,047 $ 1,666 Up 83%
Net income per diluted share $ 4.82 $ 2.57 Up 88%
Revenue for fiscal year 2018 grew 41% to $9.71 billion, reflecting broad growth in each of our market platforms - gaming, professional visualization,
datacenter, and automotive.
GPU business revenue was $8.14 billion, up 40% from a year earlier, led by growth in gaming, datacenter, and professional visualization. Strong
growth across our Pascal-based GeForce gaming GPUs was driven by growth associated with GPU refreshes/upgrades, new gamers, new games,
eSports, and cryptocurrency mining. Revenue for datacenter, including Tesla, NVIDIA GRID and NVIDIA DGX, was $1.93 billion, up 133% year on
year, led by strong sales of our Volta architecture, including V100 GPU accelerators, which began shipping in the first half of fiscal year 2018 and
are available through major computer makers and cloud providers, new DGX systems, and design wins in HPC. Professional visualization revenue
grew 12% year over year to $934 million, led by ultra-high-end and high-end desktop workstations, as well as unique form factors and emerging
opportunities, including AI, deep learning, VR and rendering.

Table of Contents
Tegra processor business revenue was $1.53 billion, up 86% from a year ago. Tegra processor business revenue includes SOC modules for the
Nintendo Switch gaming console and development services. Also included was automotive revenue of $558 million, which was up 15% from a year
earlier, incorporating infotainment modules, production DRIVE PX platforms, and development agreements for self-driving cars.
Revenue from our patent license agreement with Intel concluded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 .
Gross margin for fiscal year 2018 was 59.9%, compared with 58.8% a year earlier, reflecting a favorable shift in mix, the growth of our GeForce
gaming GPUs, and the growth of our GPU computing platform for cloud, deep learning, AI, and graphics virtualization, partially offset by the
conclusion of our patent license agreement with Intel.
Operating expenses for fiscal year 2018 were $2.61 billion, up from $2.13 billion in the previous year. This reflects growth in employees and related
costs, as well as investments in growth initiatives, including gaming, AI, and autonomous driving.
We recorded a U.S. tax reform provisional net tax benefit of $133 million associated with the one-time transition tax on our historical foreign earnings
and the adjustment of deferred tax balances to the lower corporate tax rate.
Net income and net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2018 were $3.05 billion and $4.82, respectively, up 83% and 88%, respectively, from a
year earlier, fueled by strong revenue growth and improved gross and operating margins.
We returned $1.25 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2018 through a combination of $909 million in share repurchases and $341 million in
quarterly cash dividends. In November 2017, we declared an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.15 per share from $0.14 per share. For
fiscal year 2019, we intend to return $1.25 billion to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases.
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $7.11 billion as of January 28, 2018 , compared with $6.80 billion as of January 29, 2017 .
The increase was primarily related to the increase in operating income.
GPU Business
During fiscal year 2018 , we released many new gaming GPU products based on our new NVIDIA Pascal architecture, including GeForce GTX 1070
Ti, 1080 Ti, and TITAN Xp. We also announced gaming laptops using the Max-Q design, which are 3x faster and 3x thinner than previous-
generation gaming laptops, and enhanced GeForce Experience with new tools, including NVIDIA Freestyle for customizing gameplay and an
updated interface for the NVIDIA Ansel™ photo mode, as well as new titles including PlayerUnknown's Battleground and Fortnite that support
NVIDIA ShadowPlay™ Highlights for capturing gaming achievements.
For our professional visualization platform, we opened early access to NVIDIA Holodeck, and launched the Quadro Virtual Data Center Workstation;
introduced Project Holodeck, a photorealistic, collaborative VR environment; launched external GPU support for creative professionals; and released
the NVIDIA Optix 5.0 and NVIDIA VRWorks 360 Video software development kits.
For our datacenter platform, we announced that NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU accelerators are available through virtually every major computer maker
and have been chosen by nearly every major cloud provider to deliver AI and HPC. We added 34 GPU-accelerated systems to the Top 500
supercomputer list, bringing the total number of systems relying on NVIDIA GPUs to 87, announced partnerships to further AI in key vertical
industries, and launched the NVIDIA GPU Cloud container registry to support scientists using HPC applications and AI researchers using desktop
GPUs.
Tegra Processor Business
During fiscal year 2018 , for the automotive market, we announced the NVIDIA DRIVE AI self-driving platform, which enables automakers and Tier-1
suppliers to accelerate production of automated and autonomous vehicles, the NVIDIA DRIVE Xavier autonomous machine processor to power the
NVIDIA DRIVE software stack, and NVIDIA DRIVE PX Pegasus, an auto-grade AI computer designed to enable driverless robotaxis without
steering wheels, pedals or mirrors. We also announced several new partnerships aimed at getting AI-powered cars, trucks and commercial vehicles
on the road, including partnerships with Aurora, Autoliv, Baidu, Bosch, Continental, Mercedes-Benz, Uber, Volkswagen, Volvo, Toyota, and ZF.
In addition, we introduced NVIDIA Jetson TX2, a high-performance, low-power computer platform for delivering AI at the edge, with deep learning
and computer vision capabilities for robots, drones and smart cameras, the NVIDIA Isaac robot simulator for training intelligent machines in
simulated real-world conditions before deployment, and the NVIDIA Metropolis platform, used by more than 50 partners to make cities safer and

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue,
expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition,
inventories, income taxes, goodwill, cash equivalents and marketable securities, stock-based compensation, and litigation, investigation and
settlement costs and other contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the
Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and
estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Revenue Recognition
Product Revenue
We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed or
determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
Our customer programs primarily involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target
markets. We account for rebates as a reduction of revenue and accrue for 100% of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor, as we
typically find that over 95% of the rebates we accrue each year are eventually claimed, which is substantially close to 100%, and that this
percentage varies by program and by customer. We recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related
revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate. Rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale, unless we reasonably believe
that the customer intends to claim the rebate. Unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue, the amount of which typically represents less than 0.5%
of total revenue.
Our customer programs also include marketing development funds, or MDFs. MDFs represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for
market segment development and expansion and are typically designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products.
We account for MDFs as a reduction of revenue and apply a breakage factor to certain types of MDF program accruals for which we believe we can
make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be unclaimed.
We also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized,
based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine
that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.
License and Development Revenue
For license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components, we generally recognize the related revenue
over the period that services are performed. For most license and service arrangements, we determine progress to completion based on actual cost
incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete the project. We periodically evaluate the actual status of each
project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate. Revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress
toward completion of projects in progress. Significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total cost. Any changes in or
deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period.
For license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the
license agreement, we record revenue over the life of the license term, with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified
as deferred revenue.

Inventories
Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. We charge cost
of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess
inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product
purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and m arket conditions.
Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions,
sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements,
failure to estimate customer demand properly, or unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition. In addition, cancellation or deferral of
customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.
The overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was insignificant in fiscal years 2018
and 2017 and an unfavorable impact of 1.6% in fiscal year 2016 . The charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions during these fiscal
years were primarily related to the write-off of excess quantities of products whose inventory levels were higher than our updated forecasts of future
demand for those products. As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future
customer demand. In doing so, we must account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. We also adjust to other market
factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may
impact demand for our products.
Refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.
Income Taxes
We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal
year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects
attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of
any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.
Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the
application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an
anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in
other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our
estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the
recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense
in our financial statements accordingly.
As of January 28, 2018 , we had a valuation allowance of $469 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management
determined are not likely to be realized due to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a
result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such
deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period.
We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the
technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax
expense.
The TCJA, which was enacted in December 2017, significantly changes U.S. tax law, including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax
rate from 35% to 21%, a requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were
previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign-source earnings. As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the
TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions will impact us beginning in fiscal year 2019. Refer to Note
13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information specific to
accounting for income taxes and the impacts from the enactment of the TCJA.

Goodwill
Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier, if indicators of potential impairment exist,
using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the
goodwill resides to its carrying value. We have identified two reporting units, GPU and Tegra Processor, for the purposes of completing our goodwill
analysis. Goodwill assigned to the GPU and Tegra Processor reporting units as of January 28, 2018 was $210 million and $408 million ,
respectively. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and
assumptions. We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units. We base our fair value
estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain.
We use the quantitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit. In applying the fair value based test of each reporting
unit, the results from the income approach and the market approach were equally weighted. These valuation approaches consider a number of
factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, terminal or residual values, discount rates and comparable
multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic
factors and the future profitability of our business.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 , we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill. The fair values of our GPU and Tegra
Processor reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values. As such, even the application of a hypotheti cal 10% decrease to
the fair value of each reporting unit would not have resulted in the fair value of either reporting unit being less than its carrying value.

information.
Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
Cash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the
time of acquisition. Marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months when purchased.
We measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value. The fair values of our financial assets are determined using quoted
market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets. All of our available-for-sale investments are subject
to a periodic impairment review. We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be other-
than-temporary, or have other indicators of impairments.
We performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of January 28, 2018 . We concluded that our investments were appropriately
valued and that no other-than-temporary impairment charges were necessary on our portfolio of available-for-sale investments as of January 28,
2018 .

information.
Stock-based Compensation
Our stock-based compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units that are based on our corporate
financial performance targets, or PSUs, performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs, and our employee
stock purchase plan, or ESPP. The number of PSUs and market-based PSUs that will ultimately be awarded is contingent on the Company’s level
of achievement compared with the corporate financial performance target established by our Compensation Committee in the beginning of each
fiscal year.
Re fer to Notes 1 and 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional
information.
Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs
From time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. We are aggressively defending our current litigation
matters. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other
third-party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. If that occurs, our business,
financial condition and results of operations co uld be materially and adversely affected. If information becomes available that causes us to
determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated
with such
27

events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially
different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.

GPU Business. GPU business revenue increased by 40% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 led by growth in gaming, datacenter
and professional visualization. Revenue from sales of GeForce GPU products for gaming increased over 20%, reflecting continued strong
demand for our Pascal-based GPU products. Datacenter revenue, including Tesla, GRID and DGX, increased 133%, reflecting strong demand
from hyperscale and cloud customers for deep learning training and accelerated GPU computing as well as demand for HPC, DGX AI
supercomputing and GRID virtualization platforms. Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased by 12% due primarily to
higher sales in both high end desktop and mobile workstation products. Revenue from GeForce GPU products for mainstream PC OEMs
increased by over 90% due primarily to strong demand for GPU products targeted for cryptocurrency mining.
GPU business revenue increased by 39% in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 . This increase was primarily due to increased
revenue from our GeForce GPU gaming and datacenter platforms. Sales of high-end GeForce GPU products for gaming increased over 40%,
reflecting a combination of continued strength in PC gaming and strong demand for our recent Pascal-based GPU products. Datacenter
revenue, including our Tesla, NVIDIA GRID, and DGX-1 brands, increased by 145%, reflecting strong demand for deep learning training for AI,
cloud, accelerated, and virtualized
28

computing and initial DGX-1 sales. Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased 11% due primarily to higher sales in
high end desktop and mobile workstation products. Revenue from GeForce GPU products for mainstream PC OEMs declined compared to
fiscal year 2016.
Tegra Processor Business. Tegra Processor business revenue increased by 86% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 . This was
driven by an increase of over 300% in revenue from SOC modules for gaming platforms and development services, and an increase of 15% in
automotive revenue, primarily from infotainment modules, DRIVE PX platforms and development agreements for self-driving cars.
Tegra Processor business revenue increased by 47% in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 . This was driven by an increase of over
50% in sales of Tegra products and services serving automotive systems and an increase of almost 50% in gaming development platforms and
services compared to fiscal year 2016.
All Other. Our patent license agreement with Intel concluded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. For fiscal year 2018, we recognized related
revenue of $43 million , down from $264 million for fiscal years 2017 and 2016.
Concentration of Revenue
Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and Other Americas accounted for 79% , 80% , and 79% of total revenue for fiscal
years 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based o n the location to which the
products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location.
No single customer represented more than 10% of total revenue for fiscal year 2018. In fiscal years 2017 and 2016, we had one customer that
represented 12% and 11% of our total revenue, respectively.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors
purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs,
including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component
costs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stock-based compensation
related to personnel associated with manufacturing.
Our overall gross margin was 59.9% , 58.8% , and 56.1% for fiscal years 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively. These increases were driven
primarily by a favorable shift in mix, the growth of our GeForce gaming GPU revenue, and the growth of our datacenter revenue for cloud, deep
learning, AI, and graphics virtualization. The increase in fiscal year 2018 was partially offset by the conclusion of our patent license agreement with
Intel in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.
Charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions totaled $48 million, $62 million, and $112 million for fiscal years 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 ,
respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $35 million, $51 million, and $32 million for fiscal years 2018 ,
2017 , and 2016, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written
down was insignificant for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 , and an unfavorable impact of 1.6% for fiscal year 2016 .
A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows:
GPU Business. The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2018 when compared to fiscal year 2017 , primarily due to
strong sales of our GeForce gaming GPU products and revenue growth in datacenter, including Tesla, GRID and DGX, for cloud, deep learning,
AI, and graphics virtualization. The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2017 when compared to fiscal year 2016
primarily due to product mix resulting from increased sales of our gaming, datacenter, and professional visualization GPU products, as well as a
continued decrease in sales volumes of lower margin PC OEM products.
Tegra Processor Business. The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business increased during fiscal year 2018 when compared to fiscal
year 2017 , primarily due to revenue growth in gaming development platforms and automotive. The gross margin of our Tegra Processor
business increased during fiscal year 2017 when compared to fiscal year 2016 , primarily due to fewer inventory provisions, and the absence of
the warranty charge associated with the SHIELD tablet product recall during fiscal year 2016 .

Research and development expenses increased by 23% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 and increased 10% in fiscal year 2017
compared to fiscal year 2016 , driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including
stock-based compensation expense.
Sales, General and Administrative
Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 23% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 and increased by 10% in fiscal year
2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 , driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs,
including stock-based compensation expense. Offsetting these increases was a decrease in outside professional fees of $11 million in fiscal year
2018 and $57 million in fiscal year 2017 resulting from the resolution of our intellectual property disputes with Samsung and Qualcomm.
Restructuring and Other Charges
In fiscal year 2016, we began to wind down our Icera modem operations. As a result, our operating expenses for fiscal year 2016 included $131
million of restructuring and other charges.
Total Other Income (Expense)
Interest Income and Interest Expense
Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $69 million , $54 million , and
$39 million in fiscal years 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average invested
balances and higher yields on our investments from a rising interest rate environment.
Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes
Due 2026 issued in September 2016, and the Convertible Notes issued in December 2013. Interest expense was $61 million , $58 million , and $47
million in fiscal years 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 .
Other, Net
Other, net, consists primarily of realized gains and losses from the sale of marketable securities, sales or impairments of investments in non-
affiliated companies, losses on early conversions of the Convertible Notes, and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Net other expense
was $22 million and $25 million in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively, and was insignificant in fiscal year 2016. The net other expense in fiscal
years 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to losses on early conversions of the Convertible Notes.

Income Taxes
The TCJA, which was enacted in December 2017, significantly changes U.S. tax law, including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax
rate from 35% to 21%, a requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were
previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign-source earnings. As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the
TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions will impact us beginning in fiscal year 2019.
The corporate tax reduction is effective as of January 1, 2018. Since we operate on a fiscal year rather than a calendar year, we are subject to
transitional tax rules. As a result, our fiscal year 2018 federal statutory rate is a blended rate of 33.9%. The change in the statutory tax rate from
35% to 33.9% for fiscal year 2018 did not have a significant impact on the effective tax rate.
We recognized income tax expense of $149 million, $239 million and $129 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Our annual
effective tax rate was 4.7%, 12.5%, and 17.3% for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal
year 2018 as compared to fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to the provisional impact of the recent tax law changes and the recognition
of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year
2016 was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits from our adoption of a new accounting standard in fiscal year 2017 related to the
simplification of certain aspects of stock-based compensation accounting.
Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was lower than the blended U.S. federal statutory rate of 33.9% due primarily to income earned in
jurisdictions, including British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal
statutory tax rates, favorable recognition of the U.S. federal research tax credit, the provisional impact of the recent tax law changes in 2018, and
excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.
Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was lower than U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% due primarily to income earned in
jurisdictions, including British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal
statutory tax rates, favorable recognition in those fiscal years of the U.S. federal research tax credit, favorable discrete events primarily attributable
to the tax benefit recognized upon the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations, and adoption of an accounting standard related to stock-
based compensation in fiscal year 2017.
For fiscal year 2018, we recognized provisional amounts for the tax effects of the TCJA, which were included as components of income tax expense
and reflected in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018. We will continue to assess the impact of the recently enacted tax law on our business and
our consolidated financial statements. The final impact of the TCJA recorded by us may vary materially from the provisional impact recorded due to
a number of uncertainties and factors, including the need for further guidance and clarification of the new law by U.S. federal and state tax
authorities and the need for further guidance on the income tax accounting.
In addition to the impact on fiscal year 2018, the TCJA also establishes new tax laws that will be effective for our fiscal year 2019. While each of
these new tax laws is expected to have some impact on our tax expense for fiscal year 2019 and future periods, we expect the provision designed to
tax the low-taxed income of foreign subsidiaries to have the most significant impact.
Because of the complexity of the new tax laws on the low-taxed income of certain foreign subsidiaries, we are continuing to evaluate this provision
of the TCJA and the application of related accounting standards. Based on recent deliberations of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or
FASB, we expect to be allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (1) treating taxes due on future taxable income in the U.S. as a
current-period expense when incurred or (2) factoring such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. Our selection of an accounting policy
will depend, in part, on our analysis of relevant facts to determine what the expected impact would be under each method.

As of January 28, 2018 , we had $7.11 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $310 million from the end of fiscal
year 2017 . Our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed on our behalf by several financial institutions. Our portfolio
managers are required to follow our investment policy, which requires the purchase of high grade investment securities, the diversification of asset
types, and certain limits on our portfolio duration.
Cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 and in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year
2016, primarily due to higher net income and changes in working capital.
Cash provided by investing activities increased in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 , primarily due to a reduction in purchases of
marketable securities, partially offset by the purchase of our previously-financed Santa Clara campus building. Cash used in investing activities for
fiscal year 2017 increased from fiscal year 2016 , primarily due to higher purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and lower
proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities.
Cash used in financing activities increased in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 , primarily due to cash provided from the issuance of
$2.00 billion of Notes in fiscal year 2017 as well as higher repayments of Convertible Notes, tax payments related to employee stock plans, share
repurchases and dividend payments in fiscal year 2018. Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2017 increased from fiscal year 2016 ,
primarily due to the $2.00 billion of Notes issued in September 2016, partially offset by the repayments of Convertible Notes and $1.00 billion of
capital return to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividend payments.
Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of
January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017 , we had $ 7.11 billion and $ 6.80 billion , respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
Our marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the United States government and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial
institutions, asset-backed issuers, mortgage-backed securities by government-sponsored enterprises, and foreign government entities. These
marketable securities are denominated in United States dollars. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Part II, Item 7, Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in Part II, Item 7A and Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV,
Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
The recent TCJA that was signed into law in December 2017 subjects U.S. companies to a one-time transition tax on certain earnings of foreign
subsidiaries. Our reasonable estimate of the one-time transition tax that resulted from enactment of the TCJA is $401 million, which will be payable
in eight annual installments. Accordingly, substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the United States
as of January 28, 2018 will now be available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Capital Return to Shareholders
During fiscal year 2018 , we repurchased a total of 6 million shares for $909 million and paid $341 million in cash dividends to our shareholders. As
a result, we returned $1.25 billion to shareholders during fiscal year 2018 .
For fiscal year 2019 , we intend to return $1.25 billion to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases.
Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board's continuing determination that
the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.
Notes Due 2021 and Notes Due 2026
In fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2026. The net proceeds from the Notes were
$1.98 billion, after deducting debt discounts and issuance costs.
Convertible Notes
As of January 28, 2018 , we had $15 million of Convertible Notes outstanding. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.
Revolving Credit Facility
In fiscal year 2017, we entered into a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow, repay and re-borrow amounts from time to time, up to $575
million. The commitments under the Credit Agreement are available for a 5-year period ending on October 7, 2021. The Credit Agreement also
permits us to obtain additional revolving loan commitments and/or commitments to issue letters of credit of up to $425 million, subject to certain
conditions. As of January 28, 2018 , we had not borrowed any amounts and were in compliance with all related covenants under the Credit
Agreement.
Commercial Paper
In December 2017, we established a commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. Under the program, we can issue up to
$575 million in commercial paper. As of January 28, 2018 , there was no commercial paper outstanding.
Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements
We believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital
expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In January 2018, we terminated the off-balance sheet, build-to-suit operating lease financing arrangement related to our new Santa Clara campus
building and exercised our option to purchase the property for $335 million, which was recorded in Property and equipment, net, in our Consolidated
Balance Sheet. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for

(2) Represents our reasonable estimate of a provisional tax payable amount of $401 million for the one-time transition tax that resulted from enactment of the TCJA in
fiscal year 2018, which will be payable in eight annual installments. The first installment of $32 million is classified as a current income tax payable. The installment
amounts will be equal to 8% of the total liability, payable in fiscal years 2019 through 2023, 15% in fiscal year 2024, 20% in fiscal year 2025 and 25% in fiscal year

years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our floating and fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment portfolio is
managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses.
As of January 28, 2018 , we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments. According to our analysis, parallel
shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5% would result in changes in fair values for these investments of $14 million .
In fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2026. In fiscal year 2014, we issued $1.50
billion of Convertible Notes which had $15 million in principal amount outstanding as of January 28, 2018 . We carry the Notes at face value less
unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk
associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of the Convertible Notes changes primarily when the market price of our stock
fluctuates. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for
additional information.
Foreign Exchange Rate Risk
We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are
included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in
determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016.
Sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to
exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other
34
Table of Contents
currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of
the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us.
Additionally, we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses benefit from a
stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar.
We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. We
designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on
the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related
operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.
We also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are
denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the
change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency
denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.

Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on their evaluation as of January 28, 2018 , our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or
the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2018 based on
the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework , our management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 28, 2018 .
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2018 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
35
Table of Contents
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or
our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been
detected.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of NVIDIA Corporation:
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries as of January 28, 2018 and January
29, 2017, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended January 28, 2018, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item
15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial
reporting as of January 28, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
January 28, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal
Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on
a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
39
Table of Contents
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Our Company
Starting with a focus on PC graphics, NVIDIA invented the GPU to solve some of the most complex problems in computer science. We have
extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of artificial intelligence.
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.
All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries, except where it is made clear that the
term means only the parent company.
Fiscal Year
We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2018 and 2017 are both 52-week years and fiscal year
2016 was a 53-week year.
Reclassifications
Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.
Principles of Consolidation
Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we
evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories,
income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other
contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.
Revenue Recognition
Product Revenue
We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed or
determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. For most sales, we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases
we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement. We consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have
passed to the customer. At the point of sale, we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection is reasonably
assured. If we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured, we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes
reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of payment.
Our customer programs primarily involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target
markets. We account for rebates as a reduction of revenue and accrue for 100% of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor, as we
typically find that over 95% of the rebates we accrue each year are eventually claimed, which is substantially close to 100%, and that this
percentage varies by program and by customer. We recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related
revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate. Rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale, unless we reasonably believe
that the customer intends to claim the rebate. Unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue, the amount of which typically represents less than 0.5%
of total revenue.
Our customer programs also include marketing development funds, or MDFs. MDFs represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for
market segment development and expansion and are typically designed to support our partners’
47

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for MDFs as a reduction of revenue and apply a breakage factor to certain types of
MDF program accruals for which we believe we can make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be unclaimed.
We also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized,
based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine
that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.
License and Development Revenue
For license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components, we generally recognize the related revenue
over the period that services are performed. For most license and service arrangements, we determine progress to completion based on actual cost
incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete the project. A provision for estimated losses on contracts is made
in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. Costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded
as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts. If the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized, the excess amount is recorded as
deferred revenue.
For license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the
license agreement, we record revenue over the life of the license term, with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified
as deferred revenue.
Royalty revenue is recognized related to the distribution or sale of products that use our technologies under license agreements with third parties.
We recognize royalty revenue upon receipt of a confirmation of earned royalties and when collectability is reasonably assured from the applicable
licensee.
Advertising Expenses
We expense advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred. Advertising expenses for fiscal years 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 were $ 25
million , $17 million , and $30 million , respectively.
Rent Expense
We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period and accrue for rent expense incurred, but not paid.
Product Warranties
We generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any
manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the
point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also
accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.
Stock-based Compensation
We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted
stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo
simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs.
The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee
service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares
to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in
March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally,
we estimate forfeitures annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ
from those estimates. If factors change, the compensation expense that we record under these accounting standards may differ significantly from
what we have recorded in the current period.

Restructuring and Other Charges
Our restructuring and other charges include employee severance and related costs, the write-down of assets, and other exit costs. The severance
and related costs include one-time termination benefits as well as certain statutory termination benefits or employee terminations under ongoing
benefit arrangements. One-time termination benefits are recognized as a liability at estimated fair value when the approved plan of termination has
been communicated to employees, unless employees must provide future service, in which case the benefits are recognized ratably over the future
service period. Ongoing termination benefits arrangements are recognized as a liability at estimated fair value when the amount of such benefits
becomes estimable and payment is probable. Any contract termination costs are recognized at estimated fair value when we terminate the contract
in accordance with the contract terms. Other associated costs are recognized in the period the liability is incurred. Our operating expenses for fiscal
year 2016 included $131 million of restructuring and other charges related to the wind-down of our Icera operations, which was comprised mainly of
employee severance, facilities, and related costs. Restructuring charges were not significant for fiscal years 2018 and 2017.
Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs
From time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. We are aggressively defending our current litigation
matters. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other
third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. If that occurs, our business, financial
condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a
loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events,
we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different
from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.
Foreign Currency Remeasurement
We use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are
remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment, and
equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period,
except for those expenses related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or
losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have
not been significant.
Income Taxes
We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal
year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects
attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of
any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.
Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the
application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an
anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in
other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our
estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the
recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense
in our financial statements accordingly.
As of January 28, 2018 , we had a valuation allowance of $469 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management
determined are not likely to be realized due to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a
result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such
deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period.

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the
technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax
expense.
In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, was enacted into law. The TCJA significantly changes U.S. tax law including a reduction of
the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on the earnings of certain
foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign-source earnings. As a fiscal year-end
taxpayer, certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions will impact us beginning
in fiscal year 2019. Refer to Note 13 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income or loss. Other comprehensive income or loss components include
unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities and unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges.
Net Income Per Share
Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income
per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the
treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the effect of stock options outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net
income per share for periods when their effect is anti-dilutive. Additionally, we issued convertible notes with a net settlement feature that requires us,
upon conversion, to settle the principal amount of debt for cash and the conversion premium for cash or shares of our common stock. Our
convertible notes, note hedges, and related warrants contain various conversion features, which are further described in Note 11 of these Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements. The potentially dilutive shares resulting from the convertible notes and warrants under the treasury stock
method will be included in the calculation of diluted income per share when their inclusion is dilutive. However, unless actually exercised, the note
hedges were not included in the calculation of diluted net income per share, as their pre-exercised effect would be anti-dilutive under the treasury
stock method.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of
purchase to be cash equivalents. As of January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017 , our cash and cash equivalents were $4.00 billion and $1.77 billion
, respectively, including $ 3.79 billion and $321 million , respectively, invested in money market funds.
Marketable Securities
Marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We generally
classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These securities are reported at fair value with the related
unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. The fair
value of interest-bearing securities includes accrued interest. Any unrealized losses which are considered to be other-than-temporary impairments
are recorded in the other income or expense, net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Realized gains and losses on the sale of
marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income or expense, net, section of our
Consolidated Statements of Income.
All of our available-for-sale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is
significantly below cost basis and judged to be other-than-temporary, or have other indicators of impairments. If the fair value of an available-for-sale
debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis, an other-than-temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where (1) we intend to sell
the instrument, (2) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) a credit
loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument. In these situations, we recognize an other-than-
temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments’ amortized cost basis and its fair value. For available-
for-sale debt instruments that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss, if we do not intend to sell and it is
not more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis (amortized cost basis
less any current-period

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
credit loss), we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors. The credit loss
component is recognized in earnings while loss related to all other factors is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their
relatively short maturities as of January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017 . Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are
reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of
shareholders’ equity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are
recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the
intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are
recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged.
For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a
component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in
earnings.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts
receivable, note hedge and interest rate swap. Our investment policy requires the purchase of high grade investment securities, the diversification of
asset type and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration. All marketable securities are held in our name, managed by several investment
managers and held by one major financial institution under a custodial arrangement. Accounts receivable from significant customers, those
representing 10% or more of total accounts receivable, aggregated approximately 28% of our accounts receivable balance from two customers as of
January 28, 2018 and 29% of our account receivable balance from two customers as of January 29, 2017 . We perform ongoing credit evaluations
of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for
specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit
insurance and letters of credit.
Accounts Receivable
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required
payments. We determine this allowance by identifying amounts for specific customer issues as well as amounts based on overall estimated
exposure. Factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables, the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which
balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit.
Inventories
Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs
consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging,
manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the
cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the
lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to the write-off of
excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future
demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not
subsequently written-up.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the
estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and
accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty
years. Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under
capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
Goodwill
Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. For
the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis.
For those reporting units where a significant change or event has occurred, where potential impairment indicators exist, or for which we have not
performed a quantitative assessment recently, we perform a quantitative assessment to testing goodwill for impairment. It tests for possible
impairment by applying a fair value-based test by weighting the results from the income approach and the market approach. Refer to Note 4 of these
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets
Intangible assets primarily represent rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, acquired intellectual property, trademarks and customer
relationships and are subject to an annual impairment test. We currently amortize our intangible assets with definitive lives over periods ranging from
three to ten years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up
or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method.
Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held
and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to
be generated by the asset, or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment
charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset
group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets
and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of
the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.
Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting standards update which requires the recognition of
income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. We elected to early adopt this new
guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, which required us to reflect any adjustments as of January 30, 2017. Upon adoption of this
guidance, we recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the first day of fiscal year 2018 to decrease retained earnings by $28 million , with a
corresponding decrease to prepaid taxes that had not been previously recognized in income tax expense.
In January 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that simplifies the test for goodwill impairment. The update eliminates the
second step in the goodwill impairment test that requires an entity to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. Instead, an
entity should recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the
reporting unit, with the impairment loss not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. We adopted this guidance in the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2018 and applied it prospectively, as permitted by the standard. The adoption of this accounting guidance did not have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to amend certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and
disclosure of financial instruments. Most prominent among the amendments is the requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity
investments to be recognized through net income rather than other comprehensive income. The update will be effective for us beginning in our first
quarter of fiscal year 2019. We anticipate the adoption of this accounting standard to increase the volatility of our other income or expense, net, due
to the remeasurement of certain of our equity securities, primarily our investments in non-affiliates, for fair value changes.
52

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update regarding the accounting for leases by which we will begin recognizing lease
assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with a lease term of more than 12 months. The update will require additional disclosures
regarding key information about leasing arrangements. Under existing guidance, operating leases are not recorded as lease assets and lease
liabilities on the balance sheet. The update will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted. We
are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements. However, we expect the
adoption of this accounting guidance to result in an increase in lease assets and a corresponding increase in lease liabilities on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets.
The FASB issued an accounting standards update that creates a single source of revenue guidance under U.S. GAAP for all companies, in all
industries. We expect to adopt this guidance beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. We have
made progress in, and continue to assess changes in policies, processes, systems and controls necessary to meet the additional requirements of
the guidance. While we are still finalizing our analysis to quantify the adoption impact of the provisions of the new revenue standard, we do not
expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, we do expect to provide additional disclosure under this
guidance, including more information regarding estimates and judgments, practical expedients used, contract balances and performance
obligations.
Note 2 - Stock-Based Compensation
Our stock-based compensation expense is associated with stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units that are based on
our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs, performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs, and our
employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP.
Our Consolidated Statements of Income include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts capitalized as inventory, as follows:

Beginning fiscal year 2015, we shifted away from granting stock options and toward granting RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs to reflect
changing market trends for equity incentives at our peer companies. As of January 28, 2018, there were 5 million stock options outstanding and the
amount of unvested stock options was not significant. The number of PSUs that will ultimately vest is contingent on the Company’s level of
achievement versus the corporate financial performance target established by our Compensation Committee in the beginning of each fiscal year.
Of the total fair value of equity awards, we estimated that the stock-based compensation expense related to the equity awards that are not expected
to vest for fiscal years 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 was $156 million , $98 million , and $46 million , respectively.

The fair value of shares issued under our ESPP have been estimated with the following assumptions:

2018 2017 2016
(Using the Black-Scholes model)
ESPP
Weighted average expected life (in years) 0.5-2.0 0.5-2.0 0.5-2.0
Risk-free interest rate 0.8%-1.4% 0.5%-0.9% 0.1%-0.7%
Volatility 40%-54% 30%-39% 24%-34%
Dividend yield 0.3%-0.5% 0.7%-1.4% 1.5%-1.8%
For ESPP shares, the expected term represents the average term from the first day of the offering period to the purchase date. The risk-free interest
rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest rates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our
expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant
date. Our RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of RSUs, PSUs,
and market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield.
Additionally, for employee stock option, RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures annually and revise the estimates of
forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience.
Equity Incentive Program
We grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the following equity incentive plans.
Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan
In 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as most recently amended and restated, the 2007 Plan.
The 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock
appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to employees, directors and consultants.
Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. Up to 207 million shares of our common stock may be issued pursuant to stock awards
granted under the 2007 Plan. Currently, we grant RSUs,

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 28, 2018, there were 16 million shares available for future
issuance.
Stock options previously granted to employees, subject to certain exceptions, vest over a four year period, subject to continued service, with 25%
vesting on the anniversary of the hire date in the case of new hires or the anniversary of the date of grant in the case of grants to existing employees
and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter. These stock options generally expire ten years from the date of grant.
Subject to certain exceptions, RSUs and PSUs granted to employees vest over a four year period, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on
a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and (i) for grants made prior to May 18, 2016, 12.5% vesting semi-
annually thereafter, and (ii) for grants made on or after May 18, 2016, 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter. Market-based PSUs vest 100% on
approximately the three year anniversary of the date of grant. However, the number of shares subject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs that
are eligible to vest is generally determined by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of pre-determined criteria.
Unless terminated sooner, the 2007 Plan is scheduled to terminate on March 21, 2022. Our Board may suspend or terminate the 2007 Plan at any
time. No awards may be granted under the 2007 Plan while the 2007 Plan is suspended or after it is terminated. The Board may also amend the
2007 Plan at any time. However, if legal, regulatory or listing requirements require shareholder approval, the amendment will not go into effect until
the shareholders have approved the amendment.
Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In 2012, our shareholders approved the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as most recently amended and restated, the 2012 Plan, as the
successor to the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
Up to 75 million shares of our common stock may be issued pursuant to purchases under the 2012 Plan. As of January 28, 2018, we had issued 28
million shares and reserved 47 million shares for future issuance under the 2012 Plan.
The 2012 Plan is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the current
offerings adopted pursuant to the 2012 Plan, each offering period is approximately 24 months, which is generally divided into four purchase periods
of six months.
Employees are eligible to participate if they are employed by us or an affiliate of us as designated by the Board. Employees who participate in an
offering may have up to 10% of their earnings withheld up to certain limitations and applied on specified dates determined by the Board to the
purchase of shares of common stock. The Board may increase this percentage at its discretion, up to 15% . The price of common stock purchased
under our 2012 Plan will be equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each offering
period and the fair market value on each purchase date within the offering. Employees may end their participation in the 2012 Plan at any time
during the offering period, and participation ends automatically on termination of employment with us. In each case, the employee’s contributions are
refunded.

(2) Calculated as net income divided by diluted weighted average shares.
The 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes, or the Convertible Notes, are included in the calculation of diluted net income per share. The Convertible
Notes have a dilutive impact on net income per share if our average stock price for the reporting period

exceeds the adjusted conversion price of $20.0350 per share. The warrants associated with our Convertible Notes, or the Warrants, outstanding are
also included in the calculation of diluted net income per share. As of January 28, 2018, there were no warrants outstanding.
For fiscal year 2018 , our average stock price was $158.35 , which exceeded both the adjusted conversion price and the adjusted strike price,
causing the Convertible Notes and the Warrants to have a dilutive impact.
The denominator for diluted net income per share does not include any effect from the convertible note hedge transactions, or the Note Hedges, that
we entered into concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, as its effect would be anti-dilutive. In the event of conversion of the
Convertible Notes, the shares delivered to us under the Note Hedges will offset the dilutive effect of the shares that we would issue under the
Convertible Notes.
Refer to Note 11 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Convertible Notes, Note Hedges,
and Warrants.

segments.
We completed our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 and concluded that there was no impairment, as the fair value
of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values. The fair value was determined by weighing the results from the income approach and the
market approach.
These income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information,
growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make
certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business. When performing an income
approach valuation, we incorporate the use of projected financial information and a discount rate that are developed using market participant based
assumptions to our discounted cash flow model. Our estimates of discounted cash flow were based upon, among other things, certain assumptions
about our expected future operating performance, such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, risk-adjusted discount rates, and future
economic and market conditions. The market method of determining the fair value of our reporting units requires us to use judgment in the selection
of appropriate market comparables.

identical securities. We classify securities within Level 2 when pricing is obtained from real time quotes of similar securities in active markets or
alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value. There were no significant transfers between Levels
1 and 2 for fiscal year 2018. Level 3 assets are based on unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology and include our own data about
assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available under the circumstances. We did
not have any securities classified as Level 3 as of January 28, 2018 .

Note 9 - Derivative Financial Instruments
In fiscal year 2016, we entered into an interest rate swap for a portion of the operating lease financing arrangement for our new Santa Clara campus
building. In January 2018, we terminated the operating lease financing arrangement and purchased the property. Concurrently, the related interest
rate swap was terminated.
We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses.
We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses
on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating
expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of January 28, 2018 and
January 29, 2017 .

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that
are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the
change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency
denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.
The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017 :

As of January 28, 2018 , the maturities of the designated foreign currency forward contracts were three months or less. We expect to realize all
gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to these foreign currency forward contracts within the next
twelve months.
During fiscal years 2018 and 2017, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment on other
comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective. Therefore, there were no gains or
losses associated with ineffectiveness.
Note 10 - Guarantees
U.S. GAAP requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under
that guarantee. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued, including a tabular reconciliation of the
changes of the entity’s product warranty liabilities.
Accrual for Product Warranty Liabilities
We record a reduction to revenue for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized primarily based on historical return rates. Cost of
revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for
certain products. Additionally, we accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.
The estimated product returns and estimated product warranty liabilities recorded in accrued and other current liabilities on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets as of January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017 are as follows:

In connection with certain agreements that we have entered into in the past, we have provided indemnities to cover the indemnified party for matters
such as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology related
agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a
maximum stated liability. We have not recorded any liability in our Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications.

Long-Term Debt
2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026
In fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021, and $1.00 billion of the 3.20% Notes Due 2026, collectively, the Notes.
Interest on the Notes is payable on March 16 and September 16 of each year, beginning on March 16, 2017. Upon 30 days' notice to holders of the
Notes, we may redeem the Notes for cash prior to maturity, at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and a make-whole
premium. However, no make-whole premium will be paid for redemptions of the Notes Due 2021 on or after August 16, 2021, or for redemptions of
the Notes Due 2026 on or after June 16, 2026. The net proceeds from the Notes were $1.98 billion , after deducting debt discount and issuance
costs.
The Notes are our unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to any
secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. All existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be
effectively senior to the Notes.

1.00% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018
In fiscal year 2014, we issued $1.50 billion of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018. Through January 28, 2018 , we had settled an aggregate
of $1.48 billion of the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of the Company paying interest in cash
semi-annually at a rate of 1.00% per annum and will mature on December 1, 2018 unless previously repurchased or converted. Upon conversion,
we pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election, of
our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount being converted.
Holders may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at any time prior to August 1, 2018 under certain circumstances. For example,
during any fiscal quarter, if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days during a period of 30 consecutive trading
days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each
applicable trading day, the Convertible Notes become convertible at the holders' option. As this condition has been met, all outstanding Convertible
Notes are convertible at the holders’ option through April 29, 2018.
During fiscal year 2018 , we paid cash to settle $812 million in principal amount of the Convertible Notes and had $15 million in principal amount
outstanding as of January 28, 2018 . We also issued 33 million shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value and recognized a
loss of $19 million on early conversions of the Convertible Notes. Based on the closing price of our common stock of $243.33 on the last trading
day of fiscal year 2018 , the if-converted value of the remaining outstanding Convertible Notes exceeded their principal amount by approximately
$174 million . As of January 28, 2018 , the conversion rate was 49.9127 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible
Notes (equivalent to an adjusted conversion price of $20.0350 per share of common stock).
We separately accounted for the liability and equity components of the Convertible Notes as our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate
principal could be fully or partially settled in cash. The liability component was assigned by estimating
64

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

the fair value of a similar debt without the conversion feature. The difference between the net cash proceeds and the liability component was
assigned as the equity component. The initial liability component of the Convertible Notes was valued at $1.35 billion and the initial carrying value
of the equity component recorded in additional paid-in-capital was valued at $126 million . This equity component, together with the $23 million
purchaser's discount to the par value of the Convertible Notes, represented the initial aggregate unamortized debt discount of $148 million . The
debt discount is amortized as interest expense over the contractual term of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method and an interest
rate of 3.15% .
As of January 28, 2018 , the carrying value of the Convertible Notes was classified as a current liability and the difference between the principal
amount and the carrying value of the Convertible Notes was classified as convertible debt conversion obligation in the mezzanine equity section of
our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The convertible debt conversion obligation as of January 28, 2018 was not significant.

Note Hedges and Warrants
Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into a convertible note hedge transaction, or the Note Hedges. The Note
Hedges have an adjusted strike price of $20.0350 per share and allow us to receive shares of our common stock and/or cash related to the excess
conversion value that we would deliver and/or pay, respectively, to the holders of the Convertible Notes upon conversion. Through January 28,
2018 , we had received 56 million shares of our common stock from the exercise of a portion of the Note Hedges related to the settlement of $1.48
billion in principal amount of the Convertible Notes.
In addition, concurrent with the offering of the Convertible Notes and the purchase of the Note Hedges, we entered into a separate warrant
transaction, or the Warrants. In fiscal year 2017, we entered into an agreement to terminate 63 million warrants and delivered a total of 48 million
shares of common stock. In fiscal year 2018, we entered into a second agreement to terminate the remaining 12 million warrants outstanding and
delivered a total of 10 million shares of common stock. Therefore, no warrants were outstanding as of January 28, 2018 .
Revolving Credit Facility
In fiscal year 2017, we entered into a credit agreement, or the Credit Agreement, under which we may borrow, repay and re-borrow amounts from
time to time, up to $575 million , for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The commitments under the Credit Agreement are
available for a 5-year period ending on October 7, 2021. The Credit Agreement also permits us to obtain additional revolving loan commitments up
to $425 million , subject to certain conditions. As of

against NVIDIA. On September 14, 2016, NVIDIA answered the Polaris Complaint and asserted various defenses including non-infringement and
invalidity of the six Polaris patents.
On December 5, 2016, the Texas Court granted NVIDIA’s motion to transfer and ordered the case transferred to the Northern District of California.
Between December 7, 2016 and July 25, 2017, NVIDIA filed multiple petitions for inter partes review, or IPR, at the United States Patent and
Trademark Office, or USPTO, challenging the validity of each of the patents asserted by Polaris in the U.S. litigation. The USPTO instituted IPRs for
U.S. Patent Nos. 6,532,505; 7,405,993; 7,886,122; and 8,161,344. The USPTO declined to institute IPRs on U.S. Patent Nos. 7,124,325 and
8,207,976.
On June 15, 2017, the California Court granted NVIDIA’s motion to stay the district court litigation pending resolution of the petitions for IPR. The
California Court has not set a trial date.
On December 30, 2016, Polaris filed a complaint against NVIDIA for patent infringement in the Regional Court of Düsseldorf, Germany. Polaris
alleges that NVIDIA has infringed and is continuing to infringe three patents relating to control of DRAM: European Patent No. EP1428225, and
German Patent Nos. DE 10223167 and DE 1020066043668. On July 14, 2017, NVIDIA filed defenses to the infringement allegations including non-
infringement with respect to each of the three asserted patents.
An oral hearing is scheduled for February 21, 2019.
Between March 31, 2017 and June 12, 2017, NVIDIA filed nullity actions with the German Patent Court challenging the validity of each of the
patents asserted by Polaris in the German litigation.
ZiiLabs 1 Patents Lawsuit
On October 2, 2017, ZiiLabs Inc., Ltd., or ZiiLabs, a non-practicing entity, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware alleging that NVIDIA has infringed and is continuing to infringe four U.S. patents relating to GPUs: 6,683,615; 7,050,061; 7,710,425; and
9,098,943, or the ZiiLabs 1 Patents. ZiiLabs is a Bermuda corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Creative Technology Asia Limited, a Hong
Kong company which is itself is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Creative Technology Ltd. a publicly traded Singapore company. The complaint seeks
unspecified monetary damages, enhanced damages, interest, costs, and fees against NVIDIA and an injunction against further direct or direct
infringement of the ZiiLabs 1 Patents. On November 27, 2017, NVIDIA answered the ZiiLabs complaint and asserted various defenses including
non-infringement and invalidity of the ZiiLabs 1 Patents.
On January 10, 2018, ZiiLabs filed a first amended complaint asserting infringement of a fifth U.S. Patent No. 6,977,649.
ZiiLabs 2 Patents Lawsuits
On December 27, 2017, ZiiLabs filed a second complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that NVIDIA has
infringed four additional U.S. Patents: 6,181,355; 6,900,800; 8,144,156; and 8,643,659, or the ZiiLabs 2 Patents. The second complaint also seeks
unspecified monetary damages, enhanced damages, interest, costs, and fees against NVIDIA and an injunction against further direct or direct
infringement of the ZiiLabs 2 Patents.
On December 29, 2017, ZiiLabs filed a request with the U.S. International Trade Commission, or USITC, to commence an Investigation pursuant to
Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 relating to the unlawful importation of certain graphics processors and products containing the same. ZiiLabs
alleges that the unlawful importation results from the infringement of the ZiiLabs 2 Patents by products from respondents NVIDIA, ASUSTeK
Computer Inc., ASUS Computer International, EVGA Corporation, Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd., G.B.T. Inc., Micro-Star International Co., Ltd., MSI
Computer Corp., Nintendo Co., Ltd., Nintendo of America Inc., PNY Technologies Inc., Zotac International (MCO) Ltd., and Zotac USA Inc.
Accounting for Loss Contingencies
While there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe the claims made by the other parties in the above ongoing matters are without
merit and we intend to vigorously defend the actions. As of January 28, 2018 , we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated
with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, any possible loss or range of
loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in other legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary
course of its business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not
have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.

respectively.

We recognized income tax expense of $149 million , $239 million , and $129 million for fiscal years 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively. Our
annual effective tax rate was 4.7% , 12.5% , and 17.3% for fiscal years 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively.
In December 2017, the TCJA was enacted into law. The TCJA significantly changes U.S. tax law, including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate
income tax rate from 35% to 21% , a requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on
69

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign-source earnings. As a
fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions will
impact us beginning in fiscal year 2019.
The corporate tax reduction is effective as of January 1, 2018. Since we operate on a fiscal year rather than a calendar year, we are subject to
transitional tax rules. As a result, our fiscal year 2018 federal statutory rate is a blended rate of 33.9% . The change in the statutory tax rate from
35% to 33.9% for fiscal year 2018 did not have a significant impact on the effective tax rate.
U.S. GAAP requires companies to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment. However, the SEC also issued guidance that
allows companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to exceed one year. Accordingly, as of January 28, 2018, we
recognized a provisional tax benefit of $133 million as a component of income tax expense, which is our reasonable estimate of the effects of the tax
law changes on existing deferred tax balances and the calculation of the one-time transition tax.
The one-time transition tax is based on the post-1986 earnings and profits, or E&P, of our foreign subsidiaries. We had previously accrued deferred
taxes on a portion of these same earnings. We recorded a provisional one-time transition tax liability of $971 million and released the previously
accrued deferred tax liabilities of $1.15 billion , resulting in a net decrease to income tax expense of $176 million .
We have reasonably estimated, but not yet completed, the calculation of the total post-1986 E&P for our foreign subsidiaries. Our calculation of the
transition tax may change with further analysis, additional guidance from the U.S. federal and state tax authorities and additional guidance for the
associated income tax accounting.
As a result of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21%, companies were required to remeasure their deferred tax assets and liabilities
as of the date of enactment. As a result, we recorded a provisional income tax expense of $43 million on the write-down of our deferred tax balance.
The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to the provisional impact of
the tax law changes and the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal
year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits from our adoption of a new accounting
standard in fiscal year 2017 related to the simplification of certain aspects of stock-based compensation accounting.
Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was lower than the blended U.S. federal statutory rate of 33.9% due primarily to income earned in
jurisdictions, including British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal
statutory tax rates, favorable recognition of the U.S. federal research tax credit, the provisional impact of the recent tax law changes in 2018, and
excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.
Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was lower than U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% due primarily to income earned in
jurisdictions, including British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal
statutory tax rates, favorable recognition in those fiscal years of the U.S. federal research tax credit, favorable discrete events primarily attributable
to the tax benefit recognized upon the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations, and adoption of an accounting standard related to stock-
based compensation in fiscal year 2017.
As of January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017 , we had a valuation allowance of $469 million and $353 million , respectively, related to state and
certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to projections of future taxable income. To the
extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit
during the period.
As of January 28, 2018 , we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $74 million , $226 million and $281 million ,
respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will expire beginning in fiscal year 2023 and 2019, respectively. The foreign net operating loss
carryforwards of $281 million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of January 28, 2018 , we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $361
million that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2032. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $575 million , of which $554 million is
attributable to the State of California and may be carried over indefinitely, and $21 million is attributable to various other states and will expire
beginning in fiscal year 2019. Our tax attributes, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for
changes or modification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances.

Utilization of federal, state, and foreign net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may also be subject to limitations due to ownership
changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state and foreign tax provisions. If any such limitations apply, the
federal, states, or foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, as applicable, may expire or be denied before utilization.
As of January 28, 2018 , we had $447 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $413 million would affect our effective tax rate if
recognized. However, approximately $58 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax positions taken, that, if
recognized, would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that would likely attract a full valuation allowance. The $413 million of
unrecognized tax benefits as of January 28, 2018 consisted of $175 million recorded in non-current income taxes payable and $238 million reflected
as a reduction to the related deferred tax assets.
A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Balance at end of period $ 447 $ 224 $ 230
The increase in the unrecognized tax benefit in fiscal year 2018 is primarily due to the one-time transition tax imposed on foreign earnings under the
TCJA. We classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount refundable, to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of
cash for income taxes within one year. The amount is classified as a long-term liability, or reduction of long-term deferred tax assets or amount
refundable if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year.
Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of January 28, 2018 ,
January 29, 2017 , and January 31, 2016 , we had accrued $15 million , $13 million , and $11 million , respectively, for the payment of interest and
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not included as a component of our unrecognized tax benefits. As of January 28, 2018 ,
unrecognized tax benefits of $175 million and the related interest and penalties of $15 million are included in non-current income taxes payable.
While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our
accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised
estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. As of January 28, 2018 , we do not believe that our estimates, as
otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.
We are subject to taxation by a number of taxing authorities both in the United States and throughout the world. As of January 28, 2018 , the
significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include the United States, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, United Kingdom, Germany,
and India for fiscal years 2003 through 2017. As of January 28, 2018 , the significant tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under examination
include India, Taiwan, UK, and Germany for fiscal years 2003 through 2017.

Note 15 - Employee Retirement Plans
We have a 401(k) retirement plan covering substantially all of our United States employees. Under the plan, participating employees may defer up to
80% of their pre-tax earnings, subject to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limits and we match a portion of the employee
contributions. Our contribution expense for fiscal years 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 was $23 million , $12 million , and $8 million , respectively. We also
have defined contribution retirement plans outside of the United States to which we contributed $25 million , $23 million , and $21 million for fiscal
years 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively.
Note 16 - Segment Information
Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an
operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. Our operating segments are equivalent
to our reportable segments.
We report our business in two primary reportable segments - the GPU business and the Tegra Processor business - based on a single underlying
graphics architecture.
While our GPU and CUDA architecture is unified, our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro
for designers; Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brand
integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, and incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots,
drones, and cars, as well as for consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices.
Under the single unifying graphics architecture for our GPU and Tegra Processors, we leverage our visual computing expertise by charging the
operating expenses of certain core engineering functions to the GPU business, while charging the Tegra Processor business for the incremental
cost of the teams working directly for that business. In instances where the operating expenses of certain functions benefit both reportable
segments, our CODM assigns 100% of those expenses to the reportable segment that benefits the most.
The “All Other” category presented below represents the revenue and expenses that our CODM does not assign to either the GPU business or the
Tegra Processor business for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The revenue includes primarily patent
licensing revenue and the expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related
costs, legal settlement costs, contributions, restructuring and other charges, product warranty charge, and other non-recurring charges and benefits
that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.
Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Reportable segments do not record intersegment
revenue, and, accordingly, there is none to be reported. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for NVIDIA as a whole. The
table below presents details of our reportable segments and the “All Other” category.

NVIDIA CORPORATION
AMENDED AND RESTATED 2012 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
ADOPTED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE: MARCH 22, 2012
APPROVED BY THE STOCKHOLDERS: MAY 17, 2012
AMENDED AND RESTATED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE: APRIL 9, 2014
APPROVED BY THE STOCKHOLDERS: MAY 23, 2014

APPROVED BY THE STOCKHOLDERS: MAY 18, 2016
AMENDED AND RESTATED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE: DECEMBER 11, 2017
1. GENERAL; PURPOSE.
(a) The Plan is intended as the successor to and continuation of the NVIDIA Corporation 1998 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the “ 1998 Plan ”). From and after 12:01 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on the Effective Date, no additional rights to
purchase shares of Common Stock will be granted under the 1998 Plan. All rights to purchase shares granted on or after 12:01
a.m. Pacific Standard Time on the Effective Date will be granted under this Plan. Any rights to purchase shares of Common
Stock granted under the 1998 Plan will remain subject to the terms of the 1998 Plan and any offering document or other
agreements or governing documents describing the terms and conditions of offerings made pursuant to the 1998 Plan.
(i) Any shares of Common Stock that would otherwise remain available for future offerings under the 1998
Plan as of 12:01 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on the Effective Date (the “ 1998 Plan’s Available Reserve ”) will cease to be
available under the 1998 Plan at such time. Instead, that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the 1998 Plan’s Available
Reserve will be added to the Share Reserve (as further described in Section 3(a) below) and be then immediately available for
grants hereunder, up to the maximum number set forth in Section 3(a) below.
(ii) In addition, from and after 12:01 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on the Effective Date, with respect to the
aggregate number of shares subject, at such time, to outstanding grants under the 1998 Plan that would, but for the operation of
this sentence, subsequently return to the share reserve of the 1998 Plan (such shares, the “ Returning Shares ”), such shares
of Common Stock will not return to the share reserve of the 1998 Plan, and instead that number of shares of Common Stock
equal to the Returning Shares will immediately be added to the Share Reserve as and when such a share becomes a Returning
Share, up to a maximum number set forth in Section 3(a) below.
(b) The Plan provides a means by which Eligible Employees of the Company and certain Designated Companies
may be given an opportunity to purchase shares of Common Stock. The Plan permits the Company to grant a series of
Purchase Rights to Eligible Employees.
(c) The Company, by means of the Plan, seeks to retain the services of such Employees, to secure and retain the
services of new Employees and to provide incentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts for the success of the Company
and its Related Corporations.
(d) This Plan includes two components: a 423 Component and a Non-423 Component. It is the intention of the
Company to have the 423 Component qualify as an Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The provisions of the 423 Component,
accordingly, will be construed in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of Section 423 of the Code. In addition, this
Plan authorizes the grant of Purchase Rights under the Non-423 Component that does not meet the requirements of an
Employee Stock Purchase Plan because of deviations necessary or advisable to permit or facilitate participation in the Plan by
Employees who are foreign nationals
or employed or located outside of the United States while complying with applicable foreign laws; such Purchase Rights will be
granted pursuant to rules, procedures or subplans adopted by the Board designed to achieve these objectives for Eligible
Employees and the Company and its Related Corporations. Except as otherwise provided herein or determined by the Board,
the Non-423 Component will operate and be administered in the same manner as the 423 Component. In addition, under the
423 Component of the Plan, the Company may make separate Offerings which vary in terms (although not inconsistent with the
provisions in the Plan and not inconsistent with the requirements of an Employee Stock Purchase Plan) and the Company will
designate which Designated Company is participating in each separate Offering.
(e) If a Participant transfers employment from the Company or any Designated 423 Corporation participating in the
423 Component to a Designated Non-423 Corporation participating in the Non-423 Component, he or she will immediately
cease to participate in the 423 Component; however, any Contributions made for the Purchase Period in which such transfer
occurs will be transferred to the Non-423 Component, and such Participant will immediately join the then current Offering under
the Non-423 Component upon the same terms and conditions in effect for his or her participation in the Plan, except for such
modifications as may be required by applicable law. A Participant who transfers employment from a Designated Non-423
Corporation participating in the Non-423 Component to the Company or any Designated 423 Corporation participating in the 423
Component will remain a Participant in the Non-423 Component until the earlier of (i) the end of the current Offering Period
under the Non-423 Component, or (ii) the Offering Date of the first Offering in which he or she participates following such
transfer.
2. ADMINISTRATION.
(a) The Board will administer the Plan unless and until the Board delegates administration of the Plan to a
Committee or Committees, as provided in Section 2(c).
(b) The Board will have the power, subject to, and within the limitations of, the express provisions of the Plan:
(i) To determine how and when Purchase Rights will be granted and the provisions of each Offering (which
need not be identical), including which Designated 423 Corporations and Designated Non-423 Corporations will participate in
the 423 Component or the Non-423 Component.
(ii) To designate from time to time which Related Corporations of the Company will be eligible to participate
in the Plan as Designated 423 Corporations and Designated Non-423 Corporations and which Affiliates will be eligible to
participate in the Plan as Designated Non-423 Corporations and also to designate which Designated Companies will participate
in each separate Offering (to the extent the Company makes separate Offerings).
(iii) To construe and interpret the Plan and Purchase Rights, and to establish, amend and revoke rules and
regulations for its administration. The Board, in the exercise of this power, may correct any defect, omission or inconsistency in
the Plan, in a manner and to the extent it deems necessary or expedient to make the Plan fully effective.
(iv) To settle all controversies regarding the Plan and Purchase Rights granted under the Plan.
(v) To suspend or terminate the Plan at any time as provided in Section 12.
(vi) To amend the Plan at any time as provided in Section 12.
(vii) Generally, to exercise such powers and to perform such acts as it deems necessary or expedient to
promote the best interests of the Company and its Related Corporations and to carry out the intent that the 423 Component be
treated as an Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
(viii) To adopt such procedures and sub-plans as are necessary or appropriate to permit or facilitate
participation in the Plan by Employees who are foreign nationals or employed or located outside the United States. Without
limiting the generality of, but consistent with, the foregoing, the Board specifically is authorized to adopt rules, procedures and
subplans, which, for purposes of the Non-423 Component, may be outside the scope of Section 423 of the Code, regarding,
without limitation, eligibility to participate in the Plan, handling and making of Contributions, establishment of bank or trust
accounts to hold Contributions, payment of interest, conversion of local currency, obligations to pay payroll tax, determination of
beneficiary designation requirements, withholding procedures and handling of share issuances, which may vary according to
local requirements.
(c) The Board may delegate some or all of the administration of the Plan to a Committee or Committees. If
administration is delegated to a Committee, the Committee will have, in connection with the administration of the Plan, the
powers theretofore possessed by the Board that have been delegated to the Committee, including the power to delegate to a
subcommittee any of the administrative powers the Committee is authorized to exercise (and references in this Plan to the Board
will thereafter be to the Committee or subcommittee), subject, however, to such resolutions, not inconsistent with the provisions
of the Plan, as may be adopted from time to time by the Board. The Board may retain the authority to concurrently administer the
Plan with the Committee and may, at any time, revest in the Board some or all of the powers previously delegated. Whether or
not the Board has delegated administration of the Plan to a Committee, the Board will have the final power to determine all
questions of policy and expediency that may arise in the administration of the Plan.
(d) All determinations, interpretations and constructions made by the Board in good faith will not be subject to
review by any person and will be final, binding and conclusive on all persons.
3. SHARES OF COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN.
(a) Subject to the provisions of Section 11(a) relating to Capitalization Adjustments, the maximum aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the Plan will not exceed 77,932,333 shares of Common Stock
(the “ Share Reserve ”), which number is the sum of (i) 10,000,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2016 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders, (ii) 12,500,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, (iii)
32,000,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, (iv) the number of shares
subject to the 1998 Plan’s Available Reserve, in an amount not to exceed 8,432,333 shares, and (v) the number of shares that
are Returning Shares, as such shares become available from time to time, in an amount not to exceed 15,000,000 shares.
(b) If any Purchase Right granted under the Plan terminates without having been exercised in full, the shares of
Common Stock not purchased under such Purchase Right will again become available for issuance under the Plan.
(c) The stock purchasable under the Plan will be shares of authorized but unissued or reacquired Common Stock,
including shares repurchased by the Company on the open market.
4. GRANT OF PURCHASE RIGHTS; OFFERING.
(a) The Board may from time to time grant or provide for the grant of Purchase Rights to Eligible Employees under
an Offering on Offering Dates selected by the Board. Each Offering will be in such form and will contain such terms and
conditions as the Board will deem appropriate, and with respect to the 423 Component will comply with the requirement of
Section 423(b)(5) of the Code that all Employees granted Purchase Rights will have the same rights and privileges. The
provisions of separate Offerings need not be identical, but each
Offering will include (through incorporation of the provisions of this Plan by reference in the document comprising the Offering or
otherwise) the period during which the Offering will be effective, which period will not exceed 27 months beginning with the
Offering Date, and the substance of the provisions contained in Sections 5 through 8, inclusive.
(b) If a Participant has more than one Purchase Right outstanding under the Plan, unless he or she otherwise
indicates in forms delivered to the Company: (i) each form will apply to all of his or her Purchase Rights under the Plan; and (ii) a
Purchase Right with a lower exercise price (or an earlier-granted Purchase Right, if different Purchase Rights have identical
exercise prices) will be exercised to the fullest possible extent before a Purchase Right with a higher exercise price (or a later-
granted Purchase Right if different Purchase Rights have identical exercise prices) will be exercised.
(c) The Board will have the discretion to structure an Offering so that if the Fair Market Value of a share of
Common Stock on the first Trading Day of a new Purchase Period within that Offering is less than or equal to a Participant’s
Offering Date Price, then with respect to such Participant, that Offering will terminate immediately as of that first Trading Day and
such Participant will be automatically enrolled in a new Offering beginning on that first Trading Day.
5. ELIGIBILITY.
(a) Purchase Rights may be granted only to Employees of the Company or, as the Board may designate in
accordance with Section 2(b), to Employees of a Related Corporation or an Affiliate. Except as provided in Section 5(b), an
Employee will not be eligible to be granted Purchase Rights unless, on the Offering Date, the Employee has been in the employ
of the Company, a Related Corporation or an Affiliate, as the case may be, for such continuous period preceding such Offering
Date as the Board may require, but in no event will the required period of continuous employment be equal to or greater than
two years. In addition, the Board may (unless prohibited by law) provide that no Employee will be eligible to be granted Purchase
Rights under the Plan unless, on the Offering Date, such Employee’s customary employment with the Company, the Related
Corporation or the Affiliate is more than 20 hours per week and more than five months per calendar year or such other criteria as
the Board may determine consistent with Section 423 of the Code.
(b) The Board may provide that each person who, during the course of an Offering (or any specified period within
an Offering), first becomes an Eligible Employee will, on or after the day on which such person becomes an Eligible Employee,
be granted a Purchase Right under that Offering, which Purchase Right will thereafter be deemed to be a part of that Offering.
Such Purchase Right will have the same characteristics as any Purchase Rights originally granted under that Offering, as
described herein, except that:
(i) the date on which such Purchase Right is granted will be the “Offering Date” of such Purchase Right for
all purposes;
(ii) the period of the Offering with respect to such Purchase Right will begin on its Offering Date and end
coincident with the end of the original Offering; and
(iii) the Board may provide that if such person first becomes an Eligible Employee within a specified period
of time before the end of the Offering, he or she will not be granted any Purchase Right under that Offering.
(c) No Employee will be eligible for the grant of any Purchase Rights if, immediately after any such Purchase
Rights are granted, such Employee owns stock possessing five percent or more of the total combined voting power or value of
all classes of stock of the Company or of any Related Corporation (unless otherwise required by law). For purposes of this
Section 5(c), the rules of Section 424(d) of the Code will apply in determining the stock ownership of any Employee, and stock
which such Employee may purchase under all outstanding Purchase Rights and options will be treated as stock owned by such
Employee.
(d) As specified by Section 423(b)(8) of the Code, an Eligible Employee may be granted Purchase Rights only if
such Purchase Rights, together with any other rights granted under all Employee Stock Purchase Plans of the Company and
any Related Corporations, do not permit such Eligible Employee’s rights to purchase stock of the Company or any Related
Corporation to accrue at a rate which exceeds $25,000 of Fair Market Value of such stock (determined at the time such rights
are granted, and which, with respect to the Plan, will be determined as of their respective Offering Dates) for each calendar year
in which such rights are outstanding at any time.
(e) Officers of the Company and any Designated Company, if they are otherwise Eligible Employees, will be
eligible to participate in Offerings under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may (unless prohibited by law)
provide in an Offering that Employees who are highly compensated Employees within the meaning of Section 423(b)(4)(D) of the
Code will not be eligible to participate.
6. PURCHASE RIGHTS; PURCHASE PRICE.
(a) On each Offering Date, each Eligible Employee will be granted a Purchase Right under the applicable Offering
to purchase up to that number of shares of Common Stock purchasable either with a percentage or with a maximum dollar
amount, as designated by the Board but in either case not exceeding 15% of such Employee’s eligible earnings (as defined by
the Board in each Offering) during the period that begins on the Offering Date (or such other date as the Board determines for a
particular Offering) and ends on the date stated in the Offering, which date will be no later than the end of the Offering.
(b) The Board will establish one or more Purchase Dates during an Offering on which Purchase Rights granted for
that Offering will be exercised and shares of Common Stock will be purchased in accordance with such Offering.
(c) In connection with each Offering made under the Plan, the Board may specify (i) a maximum number of shares
of Common Stock that may be purchased by any Participant on any Purchase Date during such Offering, (ii) a maximum
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be purchased by all Participants pursuant to such Offering, and/or (iii) a
maximum aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be purchased by all Participants on any Purchase Date
under the Offering. If the aggregate purchase of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Purchase Rights granted
under the Offering would exceed any such maximum aggregate number, then, in the absence of any Board action otherwise, a
pro rata (based on each Participant’s accumulated Contributions) allocation of the shares of Common Stock available will be
made in as nearly a uniform manner as will be practicable and equitable.
(d) The purchase price of each share of Common Stock acquired pursuant to a Participant’s Purchase Right will
be not less than the lesser of:
(i) an amount equal to 85% of such Participant’s Offering Date Price; or
(ii) an amount equal to 85% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the applicable
Purchase Date.
7. PARTICIPATION; WITHDRAWAL; TERMINATION.
(a) An Eligible Employee may elect to authorize payroll deductions as the means of making Contributions by
completing and delivering to the Company, within the time specified in the Offering, an enrollment form provided by the
Company. The enrollment form will specify the amount of Contributions not to exceed the maximum amount specified by the
Board. Each Participant’s Contributions will be credited to a bookkeeping account for such Participant under the Plan and will be
deposited with the general funds of the Company except where applicable law requires that Contributions be deposited with a
third party or otherwise
segregated. If permitted in the Offering, a Participant may reduce (including to zero) or increase his or her Contributions. If
required under applicable law or if specifically provided in the Offering, in addition to or instead of making Contributions by
payroll deductions, a Participant may make Contributions through the payment by cash or check or wire transfer prior to a
Purchase Date, in the manner directed by the Company.
(b) During an Offering, a Participant may cease making Contributions and withdraw from the Offering by delivering
to the Company a withdrawal form provided by the Company. The Company may impose a deadline before a Purchase Date for
withdrawing. Upon such withdrawal, such Participant’s Purchase Right in that Offering will immediately terminate and the
Company will distribute to such Participant all of his or her accumulated but unused Contributions. A Participant’s withdrawal
from that Offering will have no effect upon his or her eligibility to participate in any other Offerings under the Plan, but the
Participant will be required to deliver a new enrollment form to participate in future Offerings.
(c) Unless otherwise required by applicable law, Purchase Rights granted pursuant to any Offering under the Plan
will terminate immediately if the Participant either (i) is no longer an Employee for any reason or for no reason or (ii) is otherwise
no longer eligible to participate. The Company will distribute to such individual all of his or her accumulated but unused
Contributions.
(d) During a Participant’s lifetime, Purchase Rights will be exercisable only by such Participant. Purchase Rights
are not transferable by a Participant, except by will, by the laws of descent and distribution, or, if permitted by the Company, by a
beneficiary designation as described in Section 10.
(e) The Company has no obligation to pay interest on Contributions, unless otherwise required by applicable law.
8. EXERCISE OF PURCHASE RIGHTS.
(a) On each Purchase Date, each Participant’s accumulated Contributions will be applied to the purchase of
shares of Common Stock, up to the maximum number of shares of Common Stock permitted by the Plan and the applicable
Offering, at the purchase price specified in the Offering. No fractional shares will be issued unless specifically provided for in the
Offering.
(b) If any amount of accumulated Contributions remains in a Participant’s account after the purchase of shares of
Common Stock on the final Purchase Date of an Offering and such remaining amount is less than the amount required to
purchase one share of Common Stock, then such remaining amount will be held in such Participant’s account for the purchase
of shares of Common Stock under the next Offering under the Plan, unless such Participant withdraws from or is not eligible to
participate in such Offering, in which case such amount will be distributed to such Participant after the final Purchase Date,
without interest (unless otherwise required by applicable law). If the amount of Contributions remaining in a Participant’s account
after the purchase of shares of Common Stock on the final Purchase Date of an Offering is at least equal to the amount required
to purchase one whole share of Common Stock, then such remaining amount will not roll over to the next Offering and will
instead be distributed in full to such Participant after the final Purchase Date, without interest (unless otherwise required by
applicable law).
(c) No Purchase Rights may be exercised to any extent unless the shares of Common Stock to be issued upon
such exercise under the Plan are covered by an effective registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act and the Plan is in
material compliance with all applicable laws. If on a Purchase Date the shares of Common Stock are not so registered or the
Plan is not in such compliance, no Purchase Rights will be exercised on such Purchase Date, and the Purchase Date will be
delayed until the shares of Common Stock are subject to such an effective registration statement and the Plan is in material
compliance, except that the Purchase Date will in no event be more than 27 months from the Offering Date. If, on the Purchase
Date, as delayed to the maximum extent permissible, the shares of Common Stock are not registered and the Plan is not in
material compliance with all applicable laws, no Purchase Rights will be exercised and all accumulated but unused
Contributions will be distributed to the Participants without interest (unless otherwise required under applicable local law).
9. COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY.
The Company will seek to obtain from each federal, state, foreign or other regulatory commission or agency having
jurisdiction over the Plan such authority as may be required to grant Purchase Rights and issue and sell shares of Common
Stock thereunder unless doing so would be an unreasonable cost to the Company compared to the potential benefit to Eligible
Employees which the Company shall determine at its discretion. If, after commercially reasonable efforts, the Company is unable
to obtain the authority that counsel for the Company deems necessary for the grant of Purchase Rights or the lawful issuance
and sale of Common Stock under the Plan, and at a commercially reasonable cost, the Company will be relieved from any
liability for failure to grant Purchase Rights and/or to issue and sell Common Stock upon exercise of such Purchase Rights.
10. DESIGNATION OF BENEFICIARY.
(a) The Company may, but is not obligated to, permit a Participant to submit a form designating a beneficiary who
will receive any shares of Common Stock and/or Contributions from the Participant’s account under the Plan if the Participant
dies before such shares and/or Contributions are delivered to the Participant. The Company may, but is not obligated to, permit
the Participant to change such designation of beneficiary. Any such designation and/or change must be on a form approved by
the Company.
(b) If a Participant dies, and in the absence of a valid beneficiary designation, the Company will deliver any shares
of Common Stock and/or Contributions to the executor or administrator of the estate of the Participant. If no executor or
administrator has been appointed (to the knowledge of the Company), the Company, in its sole discretion, may deliver such
shares of Common Stock and/or Contributions to the Participant’s spouse, dependents or relatives, or if no spouse, dependent
or relative is known to the Company, then to such other person as the Company may designate.
11. ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN COMMON STOCK; CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS.
(a) On a Capitalization Adjustment, the Board will appropriately and proportionately adjust: (i) the class(es) and
maximum number of securities subject to the Plan pursuant to Section 3(a); (ii) the class(es) and number of securities subject to,
and the purchase price applicable to outstanding Offerings and Purchase Rights; and (iii) the class(es) and number of securities
that are the subject of the purchase limits under each ongoing Offering. The Board will make these adjustments, and its
determination will be final, binding and conclusive.
(b) On a Corporate Transaction, then: (i) any surviving corporation or acquiring corporation (or the surviving or
acquiring corporation’s parent company) may assume or continue outstanding Purchase Rights or may substitute similar rights
(including a right to acquire the same consideration paid to the stockholders in the Corporate Transaction) for outstanding
Purchase Rights; or (ii) if any surviving or acquiring corporation (or its parent company) does not assume or continue such
Purchase Rights or does not substitute similar rights for such Purchase Rights, then the Participants’ accumulated Contributions
will be used to purchase shares of Common Stock within ten business days prior to the Corporate Transaction under the
outstanding Purchase Rights, and the Purchase Rights will terminate immediately after such purchase.
12. AMENDMENT, TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF THE PLAN.
(a) The Board may amend the Plan at any time in any respect the Board deems necessary or advisable. However,
except as provided in Section 11(a) relating to Capitalization Adjustments, stockholder approval will be required for any
amendment of the Plan for which stockholder approval is required by applicable law or listing requirements, including any
amendment that either (i) materially increases the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan, (ii)
materially expands the class of individuals eligible
to become Participants and receive Purchase Rights, (iii) materially increases the benefits accruing to Participants under the
Plan or materially reduces the price at which shares of Common Stock may be purchased under the Plan, (iv) materially extends
the term of the Plan, or (v) expands the types of awards available for issuance under the Plan, but in each of (i) through (v)
above only to the extent stockholder approval is required by applicable law or listing requirements.
(b) The Board may suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. No Purchase Rights may be granted under the Plan
while the Plan is suspended or after it is terminated.
(c) Any benefits, privileges, entitlements and obligations under any outstanding Purchase Rights granted before
an amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan will not be materially impaired by any such amendment, suspension or
termination except (i) with the consent of the person to whom such Purchase Rights were granted, (ii) as necessary to comply
with any laws, listing requirements, or governmental regulations (including, without limitation, the provisions of Section 423 of the
Code and the regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder relating to Employee Stock Purchase Plans)
including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued or amended after the Effective Date, or
(iii) as necessary to obtain or maintain favorable tax, listing, or regulatory treatment. To be clear, the Board may amend
outstanding Purchase Rights without a Participant’s consent if such amendment is necessary to ensure that the Purchase Right
and/or the Plan comply with the requirements of Section 423 of the Code.
13. CODE SECTION 409A; TAX QUALIFICATION.
(a) Purchase Rights granted under the 423 Component are intended to be exempt from the application of Section
409A of the Code under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(ii). Purchase Rights granted under the Non-423
Component to U.S. taxpayers are intended to be exempt from the application of Section 409A of the Code under the short-term
deferral exception and any ambiguities will be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent. Subject to Section 13(b)
hereof, Purchase Rights granted to U.S. taxpayers under the Non-423 Component will be subject to such terms and conditions
that will permit such Purchase Rights to satisfy the requirements of the short-term deferral exception available under Section
409A of the Code, including the requirement that the shares subject to a Purchase Right be delivered within the short-term
deferral period. Subject to Section 13(b) hereof, in the case of a Participant who would otherwise be subject to Section 409A of
the Code, to the extent the Board determines that a Purchase Right or the exercise, payment, settlement or deferral thereof is
subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Purchase Right will be granted, exercised, paid, settled or deferred in a manner that will
comply with Section 409A of the Code, including U.S. Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued
thereunder, including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the adoption of the Plan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will have no liability to a Participant or any other party if the Purchase Right that is
intended to be exempt from or compliant with Section 409A of the Code is not so exempt or compliant or for any action taken by
the Board with respect thereto.
(b) Although the Company may endeavor to (i) qualify a Purchase Right for favorable tax treatment under the laws
of the United States or jurisdictions outside of the United States or (ii) avoid adverse tax treatment (e.g., under Section 409A of
the Code), the Company makes no representation to that effect and expressly disavows any covenant to maintain favorable or
avoid unfavorable tax treatment, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, including Section 13(a) hereof. The
Company will be unconstrained in its corporate activities without regard to the potential negative tax impact on Participants
under the Plan.
14. EFFECTIVE DATE OF PLAN.
The Plan will become effective on the Effective Date. No Purchase Rights will be exercised unless and until the Plan has
been approved by the stockholders of the Company, which approval must be within 12 months before or after the date the Plan
is adopted (or if required under Section 12(a) above, materially amended) by the Board.
15. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
(a) Proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Purchase Rights will constitute general funds
of the Company.
(b) A Participant will not be deemed to be the holder of, or to have any of the rights of a holder with respect to,
shares of Common Stock subject to Purchase Rights unless and until the Participant’s shares of Common Stock acquired upon
exercise of Purchase Rights are recorded in the books of the Company (or its transfer agent).
(c) The Plan and Offering do not constitute an employment contract. Nothing in the Plan or in the Offering will in
any way alter the at will nature of a Participant’s employment, if applicable, or be deemed to create in any way whatsoever any
obligation on the part of any Participant to continue in the employ of the Company or a Related Corporation or an Affiliate, or on
the part of the Company or a Related Corporation or an Affiliate to continue the employment of a Participant.
(d) The provisions of the Plan will be governed by the laws of the State of California without resort to that state’s
conflicts of laws rules.
(e) If any particular provision of the Plan is found to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, such provision will not
affect the other provisions of the Plan, but the Plan will be construed in all respects as if such invalid provision were omitted.

as reported in such source as the Board deems reliable. Unless otherwise provided by the Board, if there is no closing sales
price for the Common Stock on the date of determination, then the Fair Market Value will be the closing sales price on the last
