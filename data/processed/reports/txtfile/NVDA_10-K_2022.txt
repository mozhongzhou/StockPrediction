innovation and continuous development, enabling cars to receive over-the-air updates to add new features and capabilities throughout the life of a
vehicle.
Business Strategies
NVIDIA’s key strategies that shape our overall business approach include:
Advancing the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform. NVIDIA’s accelerated computing platform can solve complex problems in significantly
less time and with lower power consumption than alternative computational approaches. Indeed, it can help solve problems that were previously
deemed unsolvable. We work to deliver continued performance leaps that outpace Moore’s Law by leveraging innovation across the architecture,
chip design, system, and software layers. With our acquisition of Mellanox, we strengthened our end-to-end expertise in data center architectures,
positioning us for a future when the data center is the new unit of computing. This full-stack innovation approach allows us to deliver order-of-
magnitude performance advantages relative to legacy approaches in our target markets, which include Gaming, Data Center, Professional
Visualization, and Automotive. While the computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying
architecture leveraging our GPUs and CUDA as the fundamental building blocks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to make
leveraged investments in R&D: we can support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with the same underlying technology by using a variety of
software stacks developed either internally or by third party developers and partners. We utilize this platform approach in each of our target markets.
Extending our technology and platform leadership in AI. We provide a complete, end-to-end accelerated computing platform for deep learning
and machine learning, addressing both training and inferencing. This includes GPUs, interconnects, systems, our CUDA programming language,
algorithms, libraries, and other software. GPUs are uniquely suited to AI, and we will continue to add AI-specific features to our GPU architecture to
further extend our leadership
7
Table of Contents
position. Our AI technology leadership is reinforced by our large and expanding ecosystem in a virtuous cycle. Our GPU platforms are available from
virtually every major server maker and cloud service provider, as well as on our own AI supercomputer. There are almost 3 million developers
worldwide using CUDA and our other software tools to help deploy our technology in our target markets. We evangelize AI through partnerships with
hundreds of universities and almost 10,000 startups through our Inception program. Additionally, our Deep Learning Institute provides instruction on
the latest techniques on how to design, train, and deploy neural networks in applications using our accelerated computing platform.
Extending our technology and platform leadership in computer graphics. We believe that computer graphics is fundamental to the continued
expansion and evolution of computing. We apply our research and development resources to enhance the user experience for consumer
entertainment and professional visualization applications, and create new virtual world and simulation capabilities. Our technologies are instrumental
in driving gaming forward, as developers leverage our libraries and algorithms to deliver an optimized gaming experience on our GeForce platform.
Our computer graphics platforms leverage not only our industry-leading GeForce and NVIDIA RTX GPUs, but also optimized software stacks. For
example, GeForce Experience enhances each gamer’s experience by optimizing their PC’s settings, as well as enabling the recording and sharing
of gameplay. Our Studio drivers enhance and accelerate a number of popular creative applications. Omniverse is real-time 3D design collaboration
and virtual world simulation software that empowers artists, designers and creators to connect and collaborate in leading design applications. We
also enable interactive graphics applications - such as games, movie and photo editing and design software - to be accessed by almost any device,
almost anywhere, through our cloud platforms such as vGPU for enterprise and GeForce NOW for gaming.
Advancing the leading autonomous vehicle platform. We believe the advent of AV will soon revolutionize the transportation industry. In our view,
AI is the key technology enabler of this opportunity, as the algorithms required for autonomous driving - such as perception, localization, and
planning - are too complex for legacy hand-coded approaches and will run on multiple trained neural networks instead. Therefore, we provide a full
functionally safe AI-based hardware and software solution for the AV market under the DRIVE brand, which we are bringing to market through our
partnerships with automotive original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, tier-1 suppliers, and start-ups. Our AV solution also includes the GPU-
based hardware required to train the neural networks before their in-vehicle deployment, as well as to re-simulate their operation prior to any over-
the-air software updates. We believe our comprehensive, top-to-bottom and end-to-end approach will enable the transportation industry to solve the
complex problems arising from the shift to autonomous driving.
Leveraging our intellectual property, or IP. We believe our IP is a valuable asset that can be accessed by our customers and partners through
license and development agreements when they desire to build such capabilities directly into their own products, or have us do so through a custom
development. Such license and development arrangements can further enhance the reach of our technology.
Sales and Marketing
Our worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to achieving our objective of providing markets with our high-performance and efficient computing
platforms and software. Our sales and marketing teams, located across our global markets, work closely with end customers and various industry
ecosystems through our partner network. Our partner network incorporates each industry's respective OEMs, original device manufacturers, or
ODMs, system builders, add-in board manufacturers, or AIBs, retailers/distributors, ISVs, internet and cloud service providers, automotive
manufacturers and tier-1 automotive suppliers, mapping companies, start-ups, and other ecosystem participants.
Members of our sales team have technical expertise and product and industry knowledge. We also employ a team of application engineers and
solution architects to assist our partner network in designing, testing, and qualifying system designs that incorporate our platforms. We believe that
the depth and quality of our design support are key to improving our partner network’s time-to-market, maintaining a high level of customer
satisfaction, and fostering relationships that encourage our end customers and partner network to use the next generation of our products within
each platform.

As NVIDIA’s business has evolved from a focus primarily on gaming products to broader markets, and from chips to platforms and complete
systems to software, so, too, have our avenues to market. Thus, in addition to sales to customers in our partner network, certain of our platforms are
also sold through e-tail channels, or direct to cloud service providers and enterprise customers.
Seasonality
Our computing platforms serve a diverse set of markets such as consumer gaming, enterprise and cloud data centers, professional workstations,
and automotive. Our consumer products typically see stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. In addition, based on the production
schedules of key customers, some of our products for notebooks and game consoles typically generate stronger revenue in the second and third
quarters, and weaker revenue in the fourth and first quarters. In fiscal year 2022, our demand exceeded our supply in several areas, and our
revenue did not follow historical seasonal patterns. However, there can be no assurance that these trends will continue. Our fiscal year 2022 supply-
constrained environment or historical seasonality trends may not repeat.
Manufacturing
We do not manufacture semiconductors used for our products. Instead, we utilize a fabless manufacturing strategy, whereby we employ world-class
suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. This strategy uses the expertise
of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality
control and assurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and
operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products, such as substrates
and a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products. As a
result, we can focus our resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing, and customer support. We have placed non-
cancellable inventory orders for certain products in advance of our historical lead times, paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future
supply and capacity and may need to continue to do so in the future.
We utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, to produce
our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as Amkor Technology, King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd., Omni Logistics,
LLC, Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd., and Wistron Corporation to perform assembly, testing, and packaging of most of our products
and platforms. We use contract manufacturers such as Flex Ltd., Jabil Inc., and Universal Scientific Industrial Co., Ltd., to manufacture our standard
and custom adapter card products and switch systems, and Fabrinet to manufacture our cables. We purchase substrates from Ibiden Co. Ltd.,
Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corporation, and Unimicron Technology Corporation, and memory from Micron Technology, Samsung
Semiconductor, Inc., or Samsung, and SK Hynix. We often consign key components or materials such as the GPU, SoC, memory, and integrated
circuit to the contract manufacturers.
We typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and configuration using test equipment
purchased from industry-leading suppliers such as Advantest America Inc., and then ship the semiconductors to contract manufacturers, such as
BYD Auto Co. Ltd. and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., distributors, motherboard and add-in card, or AIC, customers from our third-party
warehouses in Hong Kong, Israel, and the United States. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and
test specifications, and then ship our products to retailers, system builders, or OEMs as motherboard and AIC solutions.
Competition
The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. We believe
that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution
channels, software support, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We believe
that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will
demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect
competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours or may provide
better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among
competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.
A significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, embedded SoCs, and other accelerated, AI
computing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-performance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre
Channel and proprietary technologies. Some of our
9
Table of Contents
competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer
or technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment in the future.
Our current competitors include:
• suppliers and licensors designing discrete and integrated GPUs, custom chips and other accelerated computing solutions, such as
Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;
• large internet services companies with internal teams designing chips that incorporate accelerated computing functionality as part of their
internal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group, Alphabet, and Amazon;
• suppliers of SoC products that are embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD,
Broadcom Inc., Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, and Samsung, or companies with internal teams designing
SoC products for internal use, such as Tesla Motors; and
• suppliers of interconnect, switch and cable solutions such as AMD, Applied Optoelectronics, Inc., Arista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco, HP,
Intel, Juniper Networks, Inc., Lumentum Holdings, and Marvell Technology Group, as well as internal teams of system vendors and large
internet services companies such as Alphabet and Amazon.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and licensing
arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from February 2022 to
June 2045. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending
patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties,
organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold,
including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased
protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal
protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:
• the location in which our products are manufactured;
• our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;
• the degree to which IP laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and
• the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and regions.
We have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements.
Government Regulations
Our worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Our
acquisitions may be subject to government regulatory reviews, and the cost to comply with such regulations or costs incurred where regulatory
challenges prevent the completion of an acquisition could have a material impact on our business. On February 8, 2022, we announced the
termination of the Share Purchase Agreement by which we would have acquired Arm due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the
completion of the transaction and expect to incur a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Compliance with laws, rules, and
regulations has not otherwise had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position and we do not
currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Compliance with existing or future governmental regulations,
including, but not limited to, those pertaining to IP ownership and infringement, taxes, import and export requirements and tariffs, anti-corruption,
business acquisitions, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, competition and antitrust, advertising,
employment, product regulations, cybersecurity, environmental, health and safety requirements, the responsible use of AI, climate change,
cryptocurrency, and consumer laws, could increase our costs, impact our competitive position, and otherwise may have a material adverse impact
on our business, financial condition and results of operations in subsequent periods. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these
potential impacts.

Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance
NVIDIA invents computing technologies that improve lives and address global challenges. We integrate sound environmental, social and corporate
governance, or ESG, principles and practices into every aspect of the Company. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our
Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing and discussing with management our practices concerning ESG. We undertake an annual analysis to
ensure that our ESG priorities remain aligned with stakeholder expectations, market trends, and business risks and opportunities. These issues are
important for our continued business success and reflect the topics of highest concern to NVIDIA and our stakeholders.
The following section provides an overview of some of these principles and practices. More information can be found on the Corporate Social
Responsibility section of our website and in our annual Corporate Social Responsibility Report, or CSR Report. Information contained on our website
or in our annual CSR Report is not incorporated by reference into this or any other report we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or
the SEC. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks and uncertainties we face related to ESG.
Climate Change
In the area of sustainability, we address our climate impacts across our product lifecycle and assess risks, including current and emerging
regulations and market impacts.
In our CSR Report, we report several metrics related to our environmental impact, our most recent full reporting year being fiscal year 2021, with our
fiscal year 2022 metrics expected to be published in May 2022. There has been no material impact to capital expenditures, our results of operations
or competitive position associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, or costs from sourcing renewable energy. By the end of fiscal
year 2025, our goal is to purchase or generate enough renewable energy to match 100% of our global electricity usage for our offices and data
centers.
Whether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-performance supercomputers, improving energy
efficiency is important in our research, development, and design processes. GPUs are inherently more energy efficient than other forms of
computing because they are optimized for throughput and performance per watt rather than absolute performance. GPU servers are approximately
40x more energy efficient than traditional CPU servers for AI workloads. The power efficiency of our products is evidenced by our continued strong
presence on the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient systems. We powered 23 of the top 25 systems on the November 2021 Green500 list.
We plan to build Earth-2, an AI supercomputer dedicated to predicting the impacts of climate change. The system will build a digital twin of the Earth
on our Omniverse platform, enable scientists to do ultra-high-resolution climate modeling, and put mitigation and adaptation tools into the hands of
cities and nations so they can act with more urgency.
Human Capital Management
We believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our stakeholders. As of January 30,
2022, we had 22,473 employees in 32 countries. 16,242 were engaged in research and development and 6,231 were engaged in sales, marketing,
operations, and administrative positions.
To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented employees, including qualified
executives, scientists, engineers, and technical and non-technical staff.
Recruitment
The demand for talent in new markets such as AI and deep learning, is increasingly competitive. With differentiated hiring strategies for university,
professional, executive, and for diversity, we have been successful in attracting top talent to NVIDIA.
We attract global talent from universities, collaborations with college programs, professional organization affiliations, industry conferences,
community resource group participation, direct sourcing and outreach. Our employees play an important part in recruiting, with over 39% of our new
hires coming from employee referrals.
Development and Retention
To support employee advancement, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training programs, one on one coaching and ongoing
feedback. We have a rich library of live and on-demand learning experiences that include workshops, panel discussions, and speaker forums. We
curate learning paths focused on our most common
11
Table of Contents
development needs and constantly upgrade our offerings to ensure that our employees are exposed to the most current programs and technologies
available. We offer tuition reimbursement programs to subsidize educational programs and advanced certifications. We encourage internal mobility
through career coaching that advises employees on developmental activities and pursuing internal transfer opportunities. We have implemented
specifically designed mentoring and development programs for women and employees from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure
widespread readiness for future advancement.
To evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party platform. Pulse surveys
help us gain insight into employee experience and provide ideas so that we can prioritize areas to take action. The suggestion box is an always-on,
interactive tool where employees share their thoughts about making our company a better place to work. The anonymous third-party platform is
designed to protect the identity of the reporter and provide a mechanism for reporters to follow an investigation and receive responses.
In fiscal year 2022, our overall turnover rate was 4.9%.
Compensation, Benefits, and Well-Being
Our compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company’s future. Employees receive
equity, except where unavailable due to local regulations, that is tied to the value of our stock price and vests over time to retain employees while
simultaneously aligning their interests with those of our stockholders.
We offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ physical health, well-being and financial health, including 401(k)
programs in the U.S., statutory pension programs outside the U.S., our employee stock purchase program, flexible work hours and time off, and
programs to address mental health, stress, and time-management challenges. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally and are committed to
providing tailored benefits based on community needs, including assistance for military members, additional mental health benefits, and support for
new birth parents, and those who wish to become parents.
Diversity and Inclusion
We believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports all employees, regardless of
gender, gender identity or expression, veteran status, race, ethnicity, or ability.
We have increased our efforts to recruit, develop, and retain a more diverse workforce with a focus on those historically underrepresented in the
technology field, including women, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino candidates.
Other efforts we have been or are undertaking include:
• Expanded recruiting teams and deepened our college pipeline to engage more diverse students and partnering with minority-serving
institutions and professional organizations;
• Supported the development of women employees to build a pipeline of future leaders;
• Supported underrepresented employees through our 11 internal community resource groups;
• Providing training and education to managers and peers on how to foster a supportive environment; and
• Measuring year over year progress and providing leadership visibility on diversity efforts.
As of January 30, 2022, our global workforce was 80% male, 19% female, and 1% not declared and 6% of our workforce in the United States was
composed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees.
Health and COVID-19
We support our people and their families in making their health and safety a top priority. During fiscal year 2022 and the COVID-19 pandemic, we
continued our global protocols to keep our workforce safe. For essential labs and offices that remain open, we maintained appropriate safety
protocols and social distancing guidelines. We have also made some of our offices accessible based on a clearly defined set of metrics while
adhering to government guidelines. Steps we took to support employees include:
• Providing work from home support, including reimbursement for home office equipment and certain work from home expenses;
12
Table of Contents
• Enhanced health coverage, including-COVID-19 testing, vaccine costs and support, expanded mental health resources and virtual care
offerings, and care for those with COVID-19;
• Learning and development resources on how to lead and manage remotely; and
• Opportunities for employees to socially connect with one another virtually.
We will continue a flexible work environment and have instituted Company-wide “rest days” for employees to recharge.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
In evaluating NVIDIA, the following risk factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Purchasing or owning NVIDIA common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described below. Any one of the
following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline, and you
may lose all or a part of your investment. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are
immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.
Risks Related to Our Industry and Markets
If we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets, or to identify new products, services or technologies, our revenue and financial
results may be adversely impacted.
Our accelerated computing platforms address four large markets: Gaming, Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Automotive. These markets
experience rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, new product introductions and enhancements, and industry standards.
Our strategic and business success depends on our ability to:
• timely identify emerging industry changes, and develop new or enhance existing products, services and technologies that meet the evolving
needs of these markets;
• expand the ecosystem for our products and technologies;
• accurately forecast demand in our businesses;
• meet customer safety and compliance standards, which are subject to change;
• manage product, software, and service lifecycles to maintain customer and end user satisfaction;
• develop infrastructure needed to scale our business, including related to our acquisitions, customer support, e-commerce and IP licensing
capabilities; and
• complete technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments for some of the above activities.
We make considerable investments in research and development and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history,
which may not produce meaningful revenue for several years, if at all. If we fail to develop new products, services and technologies, or if they do not
become widely adopted, our business, revenue, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Achieving design wins, which is important to our success in several businesses, may involve a lengthy process and depend on our ability to
anticipate features and functionality that customers will demand. Unanticipated changes in industry standards or disruptive technological innovation
could render our products incompatible with products developed by other companies. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry
and safety standards, our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies. Failure to obtain a particular design win may
prevent us from obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations. Furthermore, a design win does not guarantee revenue.
We cannot ensure that our strategic direction will result in products and technologies that provide value to our customers and partners. If we fail to
anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends, or if we do not appropriately adapt our strategies as market
conditions evolve, our business will be harmed.
14
Table of Contents
Competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue.
Our target markets remain competitive, and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and service offerings, industry
standards, customer needs, new entrants and consolidations. Our competitors’ products, services and technologies, such as the high-end discrete
GPUs offered by Intel and AMD, may be cheaper or provide better functionality or features than ours, which may result in lower than expected
selling prices for our products. Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities, have longer operating histories, larger customer
bases, more comprehensive IP portfolios and patent protections, new designs and more design wins, and greater financial, sales, marketing and
distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and
end user customer trends, more quickly transition their products, and secure sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials during a supply-
constrained environment, which could harm our business. In our networking business, some of our customers are also integrated circuit and switch
suppliers and have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to ours. Licensing our technology and supporting such
customers entails the transfer of IP rights that may enable such customers to develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. If we
are unable to successfully compete and respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this competitive
environment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease, which would cause our revenue to decline.
Risks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing
If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, there may be a mismatch between supply and demand, and our financial results could
be harmed.
Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions, time to market, competitor product releases
and announcements, competing technologies, and other factors, all of which can impact the timing and volume of our revenue. We sell many of our
products through channel partners, who sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners,
retailers and distributors in response to changing market conditions and demand for our products could impact our ability to properly forecast
demand.
GPUs have use cases in addition to their designed and marketed use case, such as for digital currency mining, including blockchain-based
platforms such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency
mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new
compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and
changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, have impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our
products, and can further impact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but
not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining as well as create increased aftermarket
resales of our GPUs, impact retail prices for our GPUs, increase returns of our products in the distribution channel, and may reduce demand for our
new GPUs. We have introduced Lite Hash Rate, or LHR, GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and increased the supply of CMP
in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. However, if attempts in the aftermarket to improve the hash rate capabilities
of our LHR cards are successful, our gaming cards may become more attractive to miners, increasing demand for our gaming GPUs and limiting our
ability to supply our gaming cards to non-mining customers. We cannot predict whether our strategy of using LHR cards and CMP will achieve our
desired outcome. In addition, our products may be resold on the unauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray
market products compete with our distribution channels.
Consumer and enterprise behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our Gaming, Data Center, and workstation
products, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand. These challenges may continue in the future when the effects of the pandemic
subside.
Our manufacturing lead times are very long and in some cases, extend to be twelve months or longer, which requires us to make estimates of
customers’ future demand. We have revised our process for purchasing supply as a result of the worldwide supply shortages impacting the
semiconductor industry. Our inventory and purchase commitments reflect our demand expectations for our future quarters and long-term supply and
capacity needs. These conditions could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or excess
inventory. Demand for our products may be perishable or may disappear, which would make our demand forecast more uncertain and cause us to
lose market share, perhaps permanently. To shorten shipment lead times, we may build finished products and carry inventory for anticipated
demand that does not materialize. We may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments if customers cancel or defer orders or
choose to purchase from our competitors. We may write-down our
15
Table of Contents
inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or excess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we
incorrectly forecast product demand.
Situations that may result in excess inventory or related impairments include:
• changes in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased consumer confidence, including downturns in our target markets
and/or overall economy and changes in the credit market;
• higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;
• new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand due to unexpected end use cases;
• increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;
• fluctuations in demand for our products related to cryptocurrency mining; or
• decrease in future demand, decrease in the cost of supply chain materials, or changes in the design of future products where we have
entered into long-term supply commitments, including prepayments, particularly to the extent we are placing orders well in advance of our
historical lead times and/or before the design of those products is final.
Conversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to
increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. We may also face supply constraints
caused by natural disasters or other events. If we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a
cost-effective or timely manner. If we fail to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we
could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged.
In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, as we are in today, we have
placed and may continue to place non-cancellable inventory orders in advance of our historical lead times, and pay premiums and/or provide
deposits to secure future supply and capacity. For example, while we previously placed orders with approximately six months’ lead time, we have
begun placing orders at least twelve months in advance. Our inventory and purchase commitments reflect our demand expectations for our future
quarters and long-term supply and capacity needs. However, we may not be able to accurately predict when such periods of shortage will end, nor
do we know whether those inventory orders accurately address our current and future demand needs. These actions may increase our product
costs and trigger significant excess inventory or other charges if there is a partial or complete reduction in long-term demand for our products or if
such demand is served by our competitors, which could negatively impact our gross margins and our overall financial results.
We depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, package or design our products, which reduces our
control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedule and could
harm our business.
We do not manufacture the semiconductors used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. We depend on foundries to
manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. We do not assemble, test or package our products, but
instead contract with independent subcontractors. We also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and
verification of new products or product enhancements. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for greater functionality from
our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. While we may enter into long-term supply and capacity
commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs. We face several risks which could
adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain, negatively impact longer-term demand for our products and
services, and adversely affect our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:
• lack of guaranteed supply of wafers, components and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and component prices, from
incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient quantities or in a timely manner;
• failure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or to provide adequate levels of manufacturing or test capacity
for our products;
16
Table of Contents
• failure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality process technologies, including transitions to smaller
geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products;
• limited number of global suppliers, foundries, contract manufacturers, assembly and test providers, and memory manufacturers;
• loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing
volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier;
• lack of direct control over product quantity, quality and delivery schedules;
• delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries
prioritize our competitors’ orders over ours; and
• low manufacturing yields resulting from a failure in our product design or a foundry’s proprietary process technology.
If our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects, our reputation could be
damaged, and we could lose market share.
Our hardware and software product offerings are complex and may contain defects or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or
unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. These risks may
increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications or as new versions are released. Some errors in
our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products
or services could expose our end customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that could attack
our products or services. Defects or failure of our products to perform to specifications could lead to substantial damage to the products or the
product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any
such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise, write-off the
value of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue.
An error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to
achieve market acceptance, loss of design wins, and harm to our relationships with existing and prospective customers and partners and
consumers’ perceptions of our brand, which would in turn negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results.
We may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in the field. If a product
liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management
personnel and harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable
terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.
Risks Related to Our Global Operating Business
We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations, including adverse economic conditions, which may
harm our business.
We conduct our business and have offices worldwide. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third
parties located outside of the United States and we generated 84% of our revenue for fiscal year 2022 from sales outside of the United States. The
global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations, including:
• domestic and international economic and political conditions between countries in which we do business;
• differing legal standards with respect to protection of IP and employment practices;
• domestic and international business and cultural practices that differ;
• disruptions to capital markets and/or currency fluctuations; and
17
Table of Contents
• natural disasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues, and other catastrophic events.
Adverse changes in global, regional or local economic conditions, including recession or slowing growth, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary,
or trade policy, higher interest rates, tighter credit, inflation, lower capital expenditures by businesses including on IT infrastructure, increases in
unemployment, and lower consumer confidence and spending, periodically occur. More recently, increased inflation may impact supply, employee,
facilities and infrastructure costs. To the extent such inflation continues, increases or both, it may reduce our margins and have a material adverse
effect on our financial performance.
Economic and industry uncertainty or changes could have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including:
• decrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers or licensees;
• the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us;
• our customers’ or our licensees’ inability to supply products to customers and/or end users;
• the insolvency of key suppliers, distributors, customers or licensees;
• limits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions;
• difficulties in obtaining capital;
• reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for
bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations;
• lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect our ability to compete
effectively; and
• increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts
on our suppliers, failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our
financial instruments.
We have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing located in Israel. The State of Israel and companies with business in Israel have
been and could in future be the subject of an economic boycott. Other countries have and may continue in the future restrict business with the State
of Israel and companies with Israeli operations. Such laws and policies may have adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business.
Climate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and those of our customers, partners and vendors. Water and energy
availability and reliability in the communities where we conduct business is critical. We have facilities in regions that may be vulnerable to the
impacts of extreme weather events. Extreme heat and wind coupled with dry conditions in Northern California may lead to power safety shut offs
due to wildfire risk. These measures can have adverse implications for our Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers, including
impairing the ability of our employees to work effectively. Climate change, its impact on our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide, and its
potential to increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and our vendors do business, may disrupt our business and
may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations. Although we maintain a program of insurance
coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and cost.
Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions, and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses
not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.
Our operations, products and services, as well as those of our suppliers and customers, may also be subject to climate-related laws, regulations and
lawsuits. Regulations such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and pollution limits could result in greater direct costs, including costs associated
with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes, increased levels of capital
expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, and higher compliance and energy costs to reduce emissions, as well as greater indirect costs
resulting from our customers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs and restrictions could
harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our
18
Table of Contents
operations and product design activities. Stakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change, and
therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm. We may not achieve our stated goal to source 100% of our global electricity use from
renewable energy by the end of fiscal year 2025, which could harm our reputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected costs to achieve such a
goal. We may also experience contractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result in
increased litigation and costs.
We also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns. We may face decreased demand for
computationally powerful but energy intensive products, such as our GPUs, despite their energy efficient design and operation, and/or increased
consumer or customer expectations around the energy efficiency of our products, could negatively impact our business.
We may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully
integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.
We have and may continue to acquire and invest in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or
enhance our existing strategic objectives.
Acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell
our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. Given that our resources are limited, if we pursue a particular
transaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. If we are unable to timely
complete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we
may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition less attractive, and other changes
can take place which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business. For example, on February 8,
2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm from
SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We intend to
record in operating expenses a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at
signing in September 2020. In addition, to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions
may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, if we hold investments in publicly traded companies, they could create volatility in our results
and may generate losses up to the value of the investment.
Risks related to acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:
• difficulty in integrating the technology, products, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees of the acquired business;
• diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention;
• assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;
• integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;
• coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;
• difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;
• difficulty or inability in obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing;
• Stock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise unable to
close an acquisition;
• legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;
• potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt
covenants or other restrictions;
19
Table of Contents
• the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;
• the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;
• negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;
• potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in which we are investing or are
acquiring; and
• impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers, as a result of our acquisition or
investment.
System security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue and
increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation.
Security breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or
hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-attacks are increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult
to successfully detect, defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures.
For example, on February 23, 2022, we became aware of a security incident involving unauthorized access to our network by a group of
independent criminal threat actors, not affiliated with any government or political cause. The threat actors obtained NVIDIA network credentials and
through deception, obtained two-factor authentication capability and access to our network. The threat actors misappropriated certain NVIDIA
proprietary information, including NVIDIA source code, and leaked some of that information online. Upon learning of the security incident, we
engaged in remedial and preventative actions, rotated all NVIDIA network credentials to prevent further unauthorized access, hardened our network,
analyzed the information that the threat actors exfiltrated, and notified law enforcement and other authorities.
Cyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, may become
more prevalent and severe. Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be limited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if
restoring from backups is delayed or not feasible.
Threat actors, sophisticated nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks.
Due to increasing geopolitical conflicts, we and the third parties upon which we rely may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of cyber-attacks.
Furthermore, we rely on products and services provided by third party suppliers to operate certain critical business systems, including without
limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, and other functions, which exposes us to supply-
chain attacks or other business disruptions. We cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners’ supply
chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our
information technology systems, including our products and services, or the third-party information technology systems that support our services.
Our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and these may not have adequate information security measures in
place. In addition, if one of our third-party suppliers suffers a security breach, our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not
have direct access to their systems, logs and other information related to the security breach.
To defend against cyber-attacks, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which is
expected to result in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop our security measures, ensure our suppliers have appropriate security
measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers. We may not always be able to detect vulnerabilities in
our security controls, systems or software, including third-party software we have installed, as such threats and techniques change frequently and
may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures
designed to address identified vulnerabilities.
Breaches of our security measures, along with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or
sensitive or confidential data about us or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information,
potentially resulting in litigation and subsequent liability, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our
business. If we or a third party we rely on experience a security incident or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may
experience adverse consequences, including government enforcement actions, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, restrictions on
processing data, litigation, indemnification obligations, reputational harm, diversion of funds, financial
20
Table of Contents
loss, loss of data, material disruptions in our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and
services, and other similar harms. Inability to fulfill orders, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could
adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.
Business disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.
Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages, telecommunications
failures, cloud service provider outages, terrorist attacks, or acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military actions,
epidemics or pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our corporate headquarters, a large portion of our
current data center capacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California, and other critical business
operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters such as
earthquakes, wildfires, or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-
party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. Geopolitical and domestic
political developments and other events beyond our control, can increase economic volatility globally. Political instability, changes in government or
adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also likely harm our business, financial
condition and results of operations. For example, the invasion by Russia of Ukraine has had and will likely continue to have a negative impact on our
employees or operations both within and outside these regions, and may result in the loss of some or even all of our assets in those regions. Our
operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics or other operations are disrupted for any reason, including
natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor,
environmental, public health, or political issues. For example, our operations could be harmed, and our costs could increase, if the conflict between
Russia and Ukraine results in a shortage of key materials that our suppliers, including our foundry partners, require to satisfy our needs. The
ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In
the event a disaster, war or catastrophic event affects us or the third-party systems on which we rely, our business could be harmed as a result of
declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. All of these risks and conditions
could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.
We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers and our revenue could be adversely affected if we
lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.
We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. With several of these
distributors and partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms through their channels. Our operating results depend on sales within our
partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners may decide to
purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way. Because
most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no
notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our
competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products, all of which may
alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability
to sell to a customer due to U.S. trade restrictions, or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and
results of operations.
If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed.
To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees and
recruit and develop diverse talent. Labor is subject to external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market
for skilled workers and leaders, cost inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic and workforce participation rates. We also must recruit and develop diverse
talent. Changes in immigration and work permit regulations or in their administration or interpretation could impair our ability to attract and retain
qualified employees. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our business may be adversely
affected. Competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation. We also must retain the key
personnel hired as a result of our acquisitions, or it could reduce the anticipated benefits of those transactions. We are highly dependent on the
services of our longstanding executive team. Failure to ensure effective succession planning, transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving
executives and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution and long-term success.
21

Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and modification or
interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.
We rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment of internal controls over
financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical and they
need to be scalable to support our growth, including for acquisitions of other businesses. We expect in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 to
commence implementation of accounting and consolidation functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. Any ERP
system problems upon implementation, such as quality issues or programming errors, could impact our continued ability to successfully operate our
business or to timely and accurately report our financial results. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose
substantial demands on management time. Failure to implement new or updated controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could
harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.
Identification of material weaknesses in our internal controls, even if quickly remediated once disclosed, may cause investors to lose confidence in
our financial statements and our stock price may decline. Remediation of any material weakness could require us to incur significant expenses and if
we fail to remediate any material weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may be required to restate our financial statements, our
ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital markets may be restricted,
the trading price of our common stock may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities.
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations.
COVID-19 has impacted, and continues to impact, our workforce and operations and those of our customers, partners, vendors and suppliers. As
the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, the increased duration and impact of economic and demand uncertainty, and the limited availability of
our supply chain and logistical services, may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results. While COVID-19 has driven
an increase in sales for certain of our products, the demand may not be sustainable if conditions change. COVID-19 containment around the world
has put restrictions on, among other areas, manufacturing facilities, commerce, and support operations could limit our capacity to meet customer
demand. Stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, which could increase our costs, limit
our ability to obtain supply at necessary levels or at all, or cause us to hold excess inventory if demand changes.
COVID-19’s effect on the global economy and our business is difficult to assess or predict. It has resulted in, and may continue to result in,
disruption of global financial markets, which could negatively affect our stock price and liquidity. Volatility in the financial markets could impact
overall technology spending, adversely affecting demand for our products, our business and the value of our common stock.
We have modified our business and workforce practices in response to COVID-19, and we may take further actions as required by government
regulations or in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. There is no certainty that our actions will be sufficient to
mitigate the risks posed by the disease, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed. When we begin to reopen our offices, we
expect to incur incremental expenses as we resume onsite services and related in-office costs.
The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance and our ability to timely execute our business
strategies may continue to be difficult to measure and predict. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations, and access to sources of liquidity and financial
condition, though the full extent and duration of these impacts is uncertain.
Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations
of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.
Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors described in these risk factors. Therefore,
investors should not rely on past comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Additional factors that could
affect our results of operations include, but are not limited to:
• our ability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;
22
Table of Contents
• our ability to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations;
• the inability of some customers to make required payments, our ability to obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to
these customers, and customer bad debt write-offs;
• unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; and
• changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards.
Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results. Any such failure to meet our
expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility.
Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters
Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other
actions may adversely impact our business.
We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and
infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash
repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity;
environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; climate change; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with
such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may impact our business operations negatively. For
example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations prohibit us from engaging in certain business practices.
There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate policies, controls, and procedures that we have
designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us,
our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Should any of these laws, rules and
regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs and/or restrictions on our ability to
manufacture our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in
anti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, and enforcement activity resulting from growing public concern over
concentration of economic power in corporations.
Government actions, including trade protection and national security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or export
regulations, including deemed export restrictions, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect
our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S.
Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other U.S. government restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and
generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, in response to the Russian invasion of
Ukraine, the United States and certain allies have imposed economic sanctions and export control measures and may impose additional sanctions
or export control measures, which have and could in the future result in, among other things, severe or complete restrictions on exports to and other
commerce and business dealings involving Russia, certain regions of Ukraine, and/or particular entities and individuals. Such actions have limited or
blocked, or could in the future limit or block the passage of our products, services and support into Russia or other regions determined to be
supporting Russia, and restrict access by our Russian or Ukrainian employees (both within and outside of Russia and Ukraine) to our systems,
negatively impacting productivity. Given these recent sanctions and export restrictions imposed by the United States and foreign government
bodies, we recently ceased product sales to Russia. While we have policies and procedures in place to ensure compliance with sanctions and trade
restrictions, our employees, contractors, partners, and agents may take actions in violations of such policies and applicable law, for which we may
be ultimately held responsible. If we were ever found to have violated U.S. export control laws, we may be subject to various penalties available
under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally,
changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and
results of operations.
Geopolitical tensions and conflicts worldwide, including but not limited to Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Israel and Korea where the manufacture of our
product components and final assembly of our products are concentrated, may result in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies, export
controls, import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and
profitability. The increasing focus on the strategic importance of AI technologies may result in additional regulatory restrictions that target products
23
Table of Contents
and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI, including some or all of our product and service offerings. Such restrictions could limit our ability
to serve demand abroad and could negatively impact our business and financial results. Deemed export control limitations could negatively impact
the ability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner.
Recent restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming
business. Additionally, revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the
imposition of import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect
on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments.
Issues relating to the responsible use of AI in our offerings may result in reputational harm and liability.
Concerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our products and services, may result in reputational harm
and liability, and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. We are increasingly building AI capabilities into many of our products and
services. AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI poses emerging ethical issues and if we
enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, or if we are unable to develop effective internal
policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of AI models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may
experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Compliance with government regulation in the area of AI ethics may also
increase the cost of related research and development. Our failure to address concerns relating to the responsible use of AI by us or others could
undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in our products and services or cause reputational harm.
Increased scrutiny from shareholders and others regarding our environmental, social and governance responsibilities could result in
additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us.
Shareholder advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, other market participants, shareholders and customers have focused
increasingly on the ESG and sustainability practices of companies, including those associated with climate change and human rights. These parties
have placed increased importance on the implications of the social cost of their investments. If our ESG practices do not meet shareholder or other
industry stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our brand, reputation and business activities may be negatively
impacted. Any sustainability report that we publish or other sustainability disclosures we make may include our policies and practices on a variety of
social and ethical matters, including corporate governance, environmental compliance, employee health and safety practices, human capital
management, product quality, supply chain management, and talent diversity and inclusion practices. It is possible that stakeholders may not be
satisfied with our ESG practices or the speed of their adoption. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor,
report, and comply with various ESG practices, or choose not to conduct business with potential customers, or discontinue or not expand business
with existing customers, due to our policies. Also, our failure, or perceived failure, to meet the standards included in any sustainability disclosure
could have a material negative impact on our reputation and business activities.
Actions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are
unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.
From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other IP rights violations by us, our
employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for claims of infringement. An unfavorable ruling could include significant damages,
invalidation of one or more patents, indemnification of third parties, payment of lost profits, or injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes
infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and
they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel.
We may commence legal proceedings in order to protect our IP rights, which may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our
operating results. We could be subject to countersuits as a result. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a
third party’s IP, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s IP rights. However, we may not be able to obtain
licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain such a license, we could be subject to substantial
liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also have to make royalty or other
payments, or cross license our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable
24
Table of Contents
terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating
expenses which could negatively impact our operating results.
We rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements, and the laws of the
countries in which we operate to protect our IP. Foreign laws may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as United States law. This
makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other
confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our
investment in research and development, product development, and marketing could be reduced. We also may face risks to our IP if our employees
are hired by potential competitors. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and
technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether we will be able to
enforce such protections.
We are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security obligations. Privacy concerns relating to our products and services
could damage our reputation, deter current and potential users from using our products and services, or result in legal or regulatory
proceedings and liability.
Our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security
laws, regulations, industry standards, external and internal policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the processing of such data by us
and on our behalf. Concerns about our practices or the ultimate use of our products and services with regard to the collection, use, retention,
security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, including for use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our
reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our partners could
result in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased security costs and costs related to
defending legal claims.
Worldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection. The European Union
adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom similarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling
of personal data of persons within the European Economic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and
the ability of persons whose data is stored to access, correct and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to comply, we could be
subject to penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and individuals may initiate litigation related to our
processing of their personal data. Furthermore, there exists a proposed European regulation related to AI that, if adopted, could impose onerous
obligations and could require us to change our business practices.
Certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws. For example, the GDPR generally restricts
the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA. The European Commission released a set of “Standard Contractual Clauses” designed
for entities to validly transfer personal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level
of protection, including the United States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and
local personal data residency laws, any of which could increase the cost and complexity of doing business. The inability to import personal data to
the United States could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, limit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to
European and other data privacy and security laws, or require us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere
at significant expense.
The United States federal, state and local governments have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including for data breach
notification, personal data privacy, and consumer protection. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, gives California residents the
right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and
shared. The CCPA allows for statutory fines of up to $7,500 per violation and the law created a private right of action for certain data breaches.
California’s privacy laws will further expand in 2023 under the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, which may restrict the use of certain
categories of sensitive personal information; further restrict the use of cross-contextual advertising techniques; restrict the retention of personal
information; expand the types of data breaches subject to the private right of action; and establish the California Privacy Protection Agency to
impose administrative fines. Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act, both of which differ
from the CPRA and become effective in 2023. If we become subject to new data privacy laws the risk of enforcement action against us could
increase as we become subject to additional obligations.
The interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are quickly changing and may
be interpreted and applied in an increasingly stringent fashion and in a manner that is
25
Table of Contents
inconsistent with our data practices. These obligations may necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems, and practices and to
those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. Despite our efforts, our personnel or third parties upon whom we rely may fail to
comply with such obligations. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, we could
face significant consequences, including but not limited to, government enforcement actions, litigation, additional reporting requirements and/or
oversight, bans on processing personal data and orders to destroy or not use personal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse
effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition.
We have exposure to tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates.
As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income-based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net
worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax
liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our
worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. For example,
we are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and under audit in Germany, Israel and
India. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, and any adverse
outcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our
business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Further, changes in United States federal and state or international
tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes, including proposed changes to existing tax rules and regulations
under the current U.S. administration and Congress and as a result of recommendations from intergovernmental economic organizations such as
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows, as we experienced
in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA. Starting in fiscal year 2023, the TCJA requires taxpayers to
capitalize research and development expenditures and to amortize domestic expenditures over five years and foreign expenditures over fifteen
years. If Congress does not modify or repeal this provision, it will materially reduce our cash flows beginning in fiscal year 2023. Furthermore, recent
proposals to increase the U.S. corporate income tax rate or impose a minimum tax on financial statement income, increase U.S. taxation of
international business operations and impose a global minimum tax, could result in increased marginal corporate tax rates. Numerous countries, as
well as organizations such as the OECD, support the global minimum tax initiative and are considering changes to existing tax laws or have
proposed or enacted new laws that could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate
our business, which could materially impact our results of operations.
Our future effective tax rate may also be affected by changes in our business or statutory rates, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are
determined to be earned and taxed, changes in available tax credits, the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, changes in United States
generally accepted accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax
purposes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances, changing interpretation of
existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies
within the income tax provision in the period in which they occur, the impact of accounting for business combinations, shifts in the amount of
earnings in the United States compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax, changes in the domestic or
international organization of our business and structure, as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits. Any changes in
our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.
Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.
We currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving
shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business. For example, we are currently defending on appeal the dismissal of
a securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders seeking to assert claims that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading
statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and regulatory
proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages or fines, or an injunction stopping us from
manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of
patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and
overall trends. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations. Our business is subject to laws
and
26
Table of Contents
regulations that are complex and change frequently. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with changes in, or remedy
violations of, these laws and regulations.
Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations, and prevent us from implementing our
strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.
As of January 30, 2022, we had outstanding a total of $11 billion in notes due by 2060. As each series of senior notes matures, unless earlier
redeemed or repurchased, we have to repay or refinance the notes. If we decide to refinance, we may be required to do so on different or less
favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all, both of which may adversely affect our financial condition. We also have a $575
million commercial paper program.
Maintenance of our indebtedness and contractual restrictions, and future issuances of indebtedness could cause us to dedicate a substantial portion
of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in
general economic, industry and competitive conditions; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;
impair our ability to obtain future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; and restrict
our ability to grant liens on property, enter into certain mergers, dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, or materially change our business.
We are required to comply with the covenants set forth in our indenture and our ability to comply may be affected by events beyond our control. If
we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the note holders or lenders, then any outstanding indebtedness may be declared
immediately due and payable. Changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities,
restrict our ability to obtain financing in the future and affect the terms of any such financing.
Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and agreement with Microsoft Corporation could delay or prevent a change in
control.
Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent
a change in control. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a
majority of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions include the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock, change
the number of directors, and to make, amend or repeal our bylaws without prior shareholder approval; the inability of our shareholders to act by
written consent or to call special meetings; advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals; and a super-majority
voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. In 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft to
develop and sell graphics chips and license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if someone
makes an offer to purchase at least 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to
purchase the stock. These provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA, discourage proxy contests, and make it more difficult for
shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER
PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common stock began on January
22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of March 11, 2022, we had approximately 313 registered shareholders,
not including those shares held in street or nominee name.
On July 19, 2021, we executed a four-for-one stock split of our common stock, such that each stockholder of record at the close of business on June
21, 2021 received a dividend of three additional shares of common stock for every share held on the record date, or the Stock Split. All share, equity
award, and per share amounts and related shareholders' equity balances presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock
Split.
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.
Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 1.04 billion shares for a total cost of $7.08 billion
through January 30, 2022.
The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be
made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market
conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common
stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.
We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2022. As of January 30, 2022, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to
repurchase shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022.
In fiscal year 2022, we paid $399 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under
that program are subject to our Board's continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the
best interests of our shareholders.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, our Board of Directors approved the retirement of all existing 349 million treasury shares. Refer to Note
15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the
retirement of our treasury shares.
Restricted Stock Unit Share Withholding
We withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock
unit awards under our employee equity incentive program. During fiscal year 2022, we withheld approximately 8 million shares for a total value of
$1.90 billion through net share settlements. Beginning with the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, the tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to
additional paid-in capital, with withheld shares assuming the status of authorized and unissued shares. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion regarding our equity incentive
plans.
Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities and Use of Proceeds
During fiscal year 2022, we issued a total of 175,333 shares of our common stock as consideration in connection with acquisitions, all in private
transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2), Regulation D, or
Regulation S.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with “Item 1A. Risk Factors”,
our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock.
Overview
Our Company and Our Businesses
NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we
have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics
and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, AV,
robotics, AR and VR.
Our two operating segments are "Graphics" and "Compute & Networking." Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.
Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges
Termination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement
On February 8, 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired
Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We
intend to record in operating expenses a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided
at signing in September 2020.
Demand
Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions, time to market, transitions, competitor product releases and
announcements, and competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and volume of our revenue. GPUs have use cases in addition to
their designed and marketed use case, such as for digital currency mining, including blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum. It is difficult for
us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of
cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in
cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, and new cryptocurrency standards can impact and have impacted in the past
cryptocurrency demand, and further impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency
standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining
and may also create increased aftermarket resale of our GPUs, impact retail prices for our GPUs, increase returns of our products in the distribution
channel, and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. We have introduced LHR GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and
increased the supply of CMP in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year
2022, nearly all our desktop NVIDIA Ampere architecture GeForce GPU shipments were LHR in our effort to direct GeForce to gamers. If attempts
in the aftermarket to improve the hash rate capabilities of our LHR cards are successful, our gaming cards may become more attractive to miners,
and therefore limit our ability to supply our cards to non-mining customers. We cannot predict whether our strategy of using LHR cards and CMP will
achieve our desired outcome. Additionally, consumer and enterprise behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic has made it more difficult for us to
estimate future demand and may have changed pre-pandemic behaviors, and these challenges may be more pronounced or volatile in the future on
both a global and regional basis. In estimating demand and evaluating trends, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be
incorrect.
Supply
Our manufacturing lead times are very long and in some cases, extend to be twelve months or longer, which requires us to make estimates of
customers’ future demand. These conditions could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or
excess inventory, and make our demand forecast more uncertain. To
30
Table of Contents
have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build finished products and maintain inventory for
anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, anticipating demand that does not materialize, or for what we believe is pent-up demand. During
fiscal year 2022, we made substantial strides in broadening our supply base to scale our company and better serve customer demand. We expect to
remain supply-constrained into the first half of fiscal year 2023, primarily in Gaming and Networking. We have placed non-cancellable inventory
orders for certain supply in advance of our historical lead times, paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity and may
need to continue to do so in the future. Ordering product in advance of our historical lead times to secure supply in a constrained environment may
trigger excess inventory or other charges if there is a partial or complete reduction in long-term demand for our products or if such demand is served
by our competitors. Given our long lead times on inventory purchasing, demand may be perishable or may disappear. Given our current long lead
times, we may order components before our product design is finalized and changes to the product design or end demand could trigger excess
inventory. Our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a quarter or year which could cause changes to expected revenue or cash
flows.
COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic continued during fiscal year 2022. Most of our employees continue to work remotely and we have paused most business
travel. During fiscal year 2022, our Gaming, Data Center and Professional Visualization market platforms have benefited from stronger demand as
people continue to work, learn, and play from home. Our Professional Visualization market platform also benefited from demand for workstations as
enterprises support hybrid work environments. As our offices begin to reopen, we expect to incur incremental expenses as we resume onsite
services and related in-office costs.
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the timing and overall demand from customers, the availability of supply chain, logistical services and
component supply, and the impact of rising inflation may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results.
We believe our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper arrangements, will be sufficient
to satisfy our working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with our
existing operations.
Fiscal Year 2022 Summary
Year Ended
January 30, January 31,
2022 2021 Change
($ in millions, except per share data)
Revenue $ 26,914 $ 16,675 Up 61%
Gross margin 64.9 % 62.3 % Up 260 bps
Operating expenses $ 7,434 $ 5,864 Up 27%
Income from operations $ 10,041 $ 4,532 Up 122%
Net income $ 9,752 $ 4,332 Up 125%
Net income per diluted share $ 3.85 $ 1.73 Up 123%
We specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These platforms incorporate
processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where our
expertise is critical: Gaming, Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Automotive.
Revenue for fiscal year 2022 was $26.91 billion, up 61% from a year ago.
Gaming revenue was up 61% from a year ago reflecting higher sales of GeForce GPUs. We continue to benefit from strong demand for NVIDIA
Ampere architecture products, and believe the increase in Gaming revenue during fiscal year 2022 resulted from a combination of factors, including:
the ramp of new RTX 30 Series GPUs; the release of new games supporting ray tracing; the rising popularity of gaming, esports, content creation
and streaming; the demand for new and upgraded systems to support the increase in remote work; and the ability of end users to engage in
cryptocurrency mining.
31
Table of Contents
Although nearly all desktop NVIDIA Ampere architecture GeForce GPU shipments are LHR to help direct GeForce GPUs to gamers, our GPUs are
capable of cryptocurrency mining. Gamers and others are therefore able to mine cryptocurrency using our GPUs, although we have limited visibility
into how much this impacts our overall GPU demand. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies or
method of verifying transactions, such as proof of work or proof of stake, can impact demand for our products and degrade our ability to accurately
estimate it. We are unable to estimate with any degree of precision the impact this volatility is likely to have in the future.
Data Center revenue was up 58% from a year ago primarily driven by sales of NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs across both training and inference
for cloud computing and AI workloads such as natural language processing and deep recommender models.
Professional Visualization revenue was up 100% from a year ago driven by the ramp of NVIDIA Ampere architecture products and strong demand
for workstations as enterprises support hybrid work environments, as well as growth in workloads such as 3D design, AI and rendering.
Automotive revenue was up 6% from a year ago due to self-driving and AI cockpit solutions offset by a decline in legacy cockpit revenue.
OEM and Other revenue was up 84% from a year ago primarily driven by CMP sales. CMP revenue was $550 million for the fiscal year and was
nominal in the prior year.
Revenue for our CMP products declined significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. We are unable to estimate with any degree of precision
the impact that volatility in the cryptocurrency market, as discussed above, is likely to have on future CMP sales.
Gross margin for fiscal year 2022 was up 260 basis points from a year ago driven by lower Mellanox acquisition-related charges, including a non-
recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million in fiscal year 2021. Margins also benefited from a higher-end mix within Gaming, partially offset by
a mix shift within Data Center.
Operating expenses for fiscal year 2022 were up 27% from a year ago primarily driven by stock-based compensation, compensation-related costs
associated with employee growth and higher infrastructure costs.
Income from operations was $10.04 billion, up 122% from a year ago. Net income and net income per diluted share were $9.75 billion and $3.85, up
125% and 123%, respectively, from a year ago.
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $21.21 billion, up from $11.56 billion a year earlier. The increase reflects operating cash flow
generation and $5.00 billion of debt issuance proceeds.
We paid $399 million in quarterly cash dividends in fiscal year 2022.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue,
expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to inventories, revenue
recognition, income taxes, and goodwill. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the
Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and
estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Inventories
Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. We charge cost
of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of
our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase
commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions,
sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements,
new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand due to unexpected end use cases, failure
to estimate customer demand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times and the impact of changes in future demand, or increase in
demand for competitive products, including competitive actions. Cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding
excess inventory.
The overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 0.9%
in fiscal year 2022 and insignificant in fiscal year 2021. As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory
based on forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so, we must account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. Our
manufacturing lead times are very long and in some cases, extend on to be twelve months or longer, which requires us to make estimates of
customers’ future demand. We place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain products in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums
and provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by
our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.
Refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.
Revenue Recognition
We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud
services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the
performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance
obligations in the contract (where revenue is
33
Table of Contents
allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each
performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.
Product Sales Revenue
Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect
to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware,
and/or software. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is
recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.
For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at
the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed
historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product
returns.
Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and
marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are
designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and
accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.
License and Development Arrangements
Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we
recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which
the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the
estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for
such loss in that period.
Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional
information.
Income Taxes
We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal
year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects
attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of
any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.
Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the
application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an
anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in
other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our
estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the
recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense
in our financial statements accordingly.
As of January 30, 2022, we had a valuation allowance of $907 million related to state and certain other deferred tax assets that management
determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, tax attributes usage limitation by certain
jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the
deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period.
We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the
technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax
expense.

Goodwill
Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier, if indicators of potential impairment exist,
using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the
goodwill resides to its carrying value. As of January 30, 2022, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $4.35 billion and the amount of goodwill
allocated to our Graphics and Compute & Networking reporting units was $361 million and $3.99 billion, respectively. Determining the fair value of a
reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We also make judgments and
assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be
reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain.
We performed our annual goodwill assessment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 using a qualitative assessment and concluded there was
no goodwill impairment.

Compute & Networking 11,046 6,841 4,205 61 %
Total $ 26,914 $ 16,675 $ 10,239 61 %
Graphics - Graphics segment revenue increased by 61% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021. We continue to benefit from strong
demand for NVIDIA Ampere architecture products, and believe the increase in Gaming revenue during fiscal year 2022 resulted from a combination
of factors, including: the ramp of new RTX 30 Series GPUs; the release of new games supporting ray tracing; the rising popularity of gaming,
esports, content creation and streaming; the demand for new and upgraded systems to support the increase in remote work; and the ability of end
users to engage in cryptocurrency mining.
Compute & Networking - Compute & Networking segment revenue increased by 61% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, driven
primarily by sales of NVIDIA Ampere architecture products to hyperscale customers for cloud computing and workloads such as natural language
processing and deep recommender models, as well as to vertical industries. The increase compared to fiscal year 2021 also reflects the strong
sales of networking products and that fiscal year 2022 includes a full year of networking revenue as Mellanox was acquired in April 2020. CMP
contributed $550 million in fiscal year 2022 compared to an insignificant amount in the prior year.
Concentration of Revenue
Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 84% and 81% of total revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021,
respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if
the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location.
No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors,
including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead
associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping
costs. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-
based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing.
Our overall gross margin was 64.9% and 62.3% for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to
lower Mellanox acquisition-related charges, including a non-recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million in fiscal year 2021. The increase also
benefited from a higher-end mix within Graphics, partially offset by a mix shift within Compute & Networking.
Inventory provisions totaled $354 million and $116 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously
written-off or written-down totaled $111 million and $145 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our
gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 0.9% in fiscal year 2022 and insignificant in fiscal year 2021.
The gross margin of our Graphics segment increased during fiscal year 2022 when compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily due to higher-end mix
within GeForce GPUs.
The gross margin of our Compute & Networking segment decreased during fiscal year 2022 when compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily due to a
shift in product mix and partially offset by a reduced contribution from Automotive solutions.

Research and Development
Research and development expenses increased by 34% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily driven by stock-based
compensation, compensation-related costs associated with employee growth and higher infrastructure costs.
Sales, General and Administrative
Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 12% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily driven by stock-based
compensation, compensation-related costs associated with employee growth, partially offset by lower amortization of intangibles.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $29 million and $57 million in
fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments.
Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes. Interest expense was $236 million
and $184 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in expense reflects interest on the $5.00 billion note issued in June 2021.
Other, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-affiliated entities and the impact of changes in
foreign currency rates. Other, net, was an income of $107 million during fiscal year 2022 and not significant during fiscal year 2021. The increase
was primarily due to unrealized gains from our investments in non-affiliated entities. Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our investments in non-affiliated entities.
Income Taxes
We recognized income tax expense of $189 million and $77 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our annual effective tax rate was
1.9% and 1.7% for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to an increase in the amount of earnings
subject to U.S. tax, and a decreased impact of tax benefits from the U.S. federal research tax credit, partially offset by the benefit of the foreign-
derived intangible income deduction, and the discrete benefit of the domestication of a foreign subsidiary, or the Domestication.
Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible
income deduction, income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands and Israel, that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal
statutory tax rate, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credit and the one-time benefits
of the Domestication.
Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions,
including the British Virgin Islands, Israel, and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, recognition of U.S.
federal research tax credits, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.

Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (9,830) $ (19,675)
Net cash provided by financing activities $ 1,865 $ 3,804
As of January 30, 2022, we had $21.21 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $9.65 billion from the end of fiscal
year 2021. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit
exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.
Cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, due to higher net income, partially offset by
changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were primarily driven by prepayments of $1.87 billion for long-term supply agreements and
increases in trade receivables due to higher revenue.
Cash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal year 2022 compared to cash provided in fiscal year 2021, reflecting lower payments in acquiring
businesses as compared to the acquisition of Mellanox in fiscal year 2021, and higher marketable securities sales and maturities, partially offset by
higher purchases of marketable securities.
Cash provided by financing activities decreased in fiscal year 2022 compared to cash provided in fiscal year 2021, which primarily reflects a debt
repayment in the fiscal year 2022 and higher tax payments on restricted stock units.
Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of
January 30, 2022, we had $21.21 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our
operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and additional
supply. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance our future
capital requirements.
Our marketable securities consist of certificates of deposits and debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated
corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer
to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
During fiscal year 2023, we expect to use our existing cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our
operations to fund our capital investments of approximately $1.4 billion related to property and equipment.
We have approximately $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any
related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S. Other than that, substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities held outside of the U.S. as of January 30, 2022 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal
income taxes. Following the Domestication, we
38
Table of Contents
have utilized almost all of our accumulated U.S. federal research tax credits during fiscal year 2022, resulting in higher cash tax payments starting in
fiscal year 2023. In addition, beginning in fiscal year 2023, the TCJA requires taxpayers to capitalize research and development expenditures and to
amortize domestic expenditures over five years and foreign expenditures over fifteen years. This will impact cash flows from operations and result in
significantly higher cash tax payments starting in fiscal year 2023. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV,
Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Capital Return to Shareholders
In fiscal year 2022, we paid $399 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under
that program are subject to our Board's continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the
best interests of our shareholders.
As of January 30, 2022, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.24
billion through December 2022. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2022.
Outstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper Program
As of January 30, 2022, we had outstanding:
• $1.25 billion of Notes Due 2023;
• $1.25 billion of Notes Due 2024;
• $1.00 billion of Notes Due 2026;
• $1.25 billion of Notes Due 2028;
• $1.50 billion of Notes Due 2030;
• $1.25 billion of Notes Due 2031;
• $1.00 billion of Notes Due 2040;
• $2.00 billion of Notes Due 2050; and
• $500 million of Notes Due 2060.
We have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of January 30, 2022, we had not issued any
commercial paper.
Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further
discussion.
Contractual Obligations
We have unrecognized tax benefits of $729 million, which includes related interest and penalties of $59 million recorded in non-current income tax
payable as of January 30, 2022. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties in
individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. We are
currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
For a description of our long-term debt, purchase obligations, and operating lease obligations, refer to Note 12, Note 13, and Note 3 of the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, respectively.
Climate Change
Refer to Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance activities. To date,
there has been no material impact to our results of operations associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, costs from sourcing
renewable energy or climate-related business trends. There are no material current climate change regulations impacting us, however, we are
monitoring potential regulation changes in California, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and other jurisdictions. We believe
that climate change has not had a material impact to our revenue to date. We have not experienced any significant physical effects of climate
change to date on our operations and results, nor any significant impacts on the cost or availability of insurance. In fiscal year 2023, we plan to build
Earth-2, an AI supercomputer dedicated to predicting the impacts of climate change and increase our purchases of Renewable Energy Credits.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Investment and Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment portfolio is managed
consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses.
As of January 30, 2022, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of
both plus or minus 0.5%, taking into account a zero percent yield floor, would result in a decrease in fair value for these investments of $33 million,
or an increase in fair value for these investments of $22 million, respectively.
At January 30, 2022, we had $11.00 billion of senior Notes outstanding. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest
rates. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional
information.
Foreign Exchange Rate Risk
We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are
included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in
determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2022 and 2021.
Sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to
exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive,
which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies
could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have international operations and incur
expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker
dollar.
We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. We
designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on
the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related
operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.
We also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are
denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the
change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency
denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.
If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately $103 million and $84 million lower as of
January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, respectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be
expected to offset a corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when recognized.
If an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have resulted in an adverse impact
on income before taxes of approximately $41 million and $44 million as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, respectively. These changes in
fair values would be offset in other income (expense), net by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary
assets and liabilities, assuming the hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances.

Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on their evaluation as of January 30, 2022, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange
Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022 based on
the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 30, 2022.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January 30, 2022 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise
resource planning, or ERP, system, which will update much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately
maintain the Company’s financial records used to report operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases with the consolidated financial reporting
and general ledger module to be implemented in fiscal year 2023. We will evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that affect our internal
control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or
our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been
detected.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of NVIDIA Corporation
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 30,
2022 and January 31, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended January 30, 2022, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index
appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
January 30, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal
Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on
a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Table of Contents
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the
consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit
matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the
critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Valuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories
As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down inventory
to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess
quantities of products, based on the Company’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future
demand and market conditions. As of January 30, 2022, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $2,605 million.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions for
excess or obsolete inventories, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing provisions for excess or
obsolete inventories, including developing assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor
judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market
conditions.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the
consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s provisions for excess or
obsolete inventories, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures also
included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories; evaluating the
appropriateness of management’s approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the
reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to
future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current
and past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, (iii) changes in technology, and (iv)
comparing prior period estimates to actual results of the same period.

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Our Company
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.
All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.
On July 19, 2021, we executed a four-for-one stock split of our common stock. All share, equity award, and per share amounts and related
shareholders' equity balances presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split.
Fiscal Year
We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2022 and 2020 were both 52-week years. Fiscal year
2021 was a 53-week year.
Reclassifications
Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.
Principles of Consolidation
Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we
evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories,
income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other
contingencies. The inputs into our judgments and estimates consider the economic implications of COVID-19. These estimates are based on
historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.
Revenue Recognition
We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud
services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the
performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance
obligations in the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to
determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance
obligation.
Product Sales Revenue
Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect
to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware,
and/or software. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is
recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.
For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at
the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed
historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product
returns.
52

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and
marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are
designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and
accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.
License and Development Arrangements
Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we
recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which
the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the
estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for
such loss in that period.
Software Licensing
Our software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase
either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software.
Software licenses are frequently sold along with the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and
upgrades. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support revenue is
recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.
Cloud Services
Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on a
subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the
contract period. Revenue related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs.
Product Warranties
We generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any
manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the
point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also
accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.
Stock-based Compensation
We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted
stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo
simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs.
The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee
service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares
to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in
March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally,
we estimate forfeitures at least annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual
forfeitures differ from those estimates.
Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs
We currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving
patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services
offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be
certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial
53
Table of Contents
NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
settlement payments or judgements. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation,
investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which
could require us to record additional costs.
Foreign Currency Remeasurement
We use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are
remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and
equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except
for those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from
foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant.
Income Taxes
We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal
year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects
attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of
any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.
Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the
application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an
anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in
other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our
estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the
recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense
in our financial statements accordingly.
As of January 30, 2022, we had a valuation allowance of $907 million related to state and certain other deferred tax assets that management
determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, tax attributes usage limitation by certain
jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the
deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period.
We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the
technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax
expense.
Net Income Per Share
Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income
per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the
treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net
income per share for periods when their effect is anti-dilutive.
Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of
purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when
purchased. We currently classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current
operations.
We classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These available-
for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income
or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of

tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are
determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of
Income.
All of our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair value of available-for-sale debt
securities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the
amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized
cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in the other income (expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements
of Income.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their
relatively short maturities as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021. Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are
reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of
shareholders’ equity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are
recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the
intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are
recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged.
For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a
component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in
earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and
accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and
credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition
and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based
on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit.
Inventories
Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs
consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including
labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products
and other component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value
or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future
product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or
written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We record a liability for noncancelable purchase
commitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the
estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and
accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty
years. Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded
under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.

Leases
We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in
operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating
lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments
over the lease term.
Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our incremental
borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease
terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
We combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.
Goodwill
Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. For
the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis.
Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the
reporting units.
Our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value. The income
and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates,
residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions
and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.
Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets
Intangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology, in-process research and development, or IPR&D,
and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our intangible
assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the
intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method. We
initially capitalize the fair value of IPR&D as an intangible asset with an indefinite life. When IPR&D projects are completed, we reclassify the IPR&D
as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortize over the asset’s estimated useful life.
Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets or asset
groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash
flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash
flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value
of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or
asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be
reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.
Business Combination
We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired,
including IPR&D, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible
and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be
reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing
intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used
56
Table of Contents
NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ
from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final
determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our
Consolidated Statements of Income.
Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.
Investment in Non-Affiliated Entities
Non-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis only if an impairment or
observable price adjustment occurs in the period with changes in fair value recorded through net income. These investments are valued using
observable and unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and
inherent lack of liquidity. The estimated fair value is based on quantitative and qualitative factors including subsequent financing activities by the
investee.
Marketable equity investments in publicly-held companies are recorded at fair value with the related unrealized and realized gains and losses
recognized in other income (expense), net.
Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement
In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard to require that an acquirer recognize and measure
contract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers. We early adopted this accounting standard in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 and the impact was immaterial.
Note 2 - Business Combination
Termination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement
On February 8, 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired
Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We
intend to record in operating expenses a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided
at signing in September 2020.
Acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.
In April 2020, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Mellanox for a total purchase consideration of $7.13 billion. Mellanox is a
supplier of high-performance interconnect products for computing, storage and communications applications. We acquired Mellanox to optimize data
center workloads to scale across the entire computing, networking, and storage stack.

(2) Represents the cash consideration for the settlement of approximately 249 thousand Mellanox stock options held by employees and non-employee directors of Mellanox.
(3) Represents the fair value of Mellanox’s stock-based compensation awards attributable to pre-combination services.
We allocated the purchase price to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values.
The goodwill is primarily attributable to the planned growth in the combined business of NVIDIA and Mellanox. Goodwill is not amortized to earnings,
but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, absent any interim indicators of impairment. Goodwill recognized in the acquisition is not
expected to be deductible for foreign tax purposes. Goodwill arising from the Mellanox acquisition has been allocated to the Compute and
Networking segment. Refer to Note 17 – Segment Information for further details on segments.
The operating results of Mellanox have been included in our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2021 since the acquisition date of April
27, 2020. Revenue attributable to Mellanox was approximately 10% for fiscal year 2021. There is not a practical way to determine net income
attributable to Mellanox due to integration. Acquisition-related costs attributable to Mellanox of $28 million were included in selling, general and
administrative expense for fiscal year 2021.

Intangible Assets
The estimated fair value and useful life of the acquired intangible assets at the time of the acquisition are as follows:
Fair Value Useful Lives

Developed technology (1) $ 1,640 5 years
Customer relationships (2) 440 3 years

Trade names (4) 70 5 years
Total identified finite-lived intangible assets 2,340
IPR&D (5) 630 N/A
Total identified intangible assets $ 2,970
(1) The fair value of developed technology was identified using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method.
(2) Customer relationships represent the fair value of the existing relationships using the With and Without Method.
(3) Order backlog represents primarily the fair value of purchase arrangements with customers using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method. The intangible asset was fully
amortized as of January 31, 2021.
(4) Trade names primarily relate to Mellanox trade names and fair value was determined by applying the Relief-from-Royalty Method under the income approach.
(5) The fair value of IPR&D was determined using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method.
The fair value of the finite-lived intangible assets will be amortized over the estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic
benefits are expected to be received to cost of revenue and operating expenses.
Mellanox has an IPR&D project associated with the next generation interconnect product that had not yet reached technological feasibility as of the
acquisition date. Accordingly, we recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset of $630 million for the fair value of this project, which was initially not
amortized. Instead, the project is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the project may be
impaired or may have reached technological feasibility. Once and if the project reaches technological feasibility, we will begin to amortize the
intangible asset over its estimated useful life.

(Using the Black-Scholes model)

Volatility 20%-58% 26%-89% 30%-82%
Dividend yield 0.1% 0.1%-0.3% 0.3%-0.4%
For ESPP shares, the expected term represents the average term from the first day of the offering period to the purchase date. The risk-free interest
rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest rates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our
expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant
date. Our RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of RSUs, PSUs,
and market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield.

Additionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in
subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience.
Equity Incentive Program
We grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the following equity incentive plans. In
addition, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, we have assumed certain stock-based awards granted under their stock incentive
plans and converted them into our RSUs.
Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan
In 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as most recently amended and restated, or the 2007 Plan.
The 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock
appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to employees, directors and consultants.
Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. As of January 30, 2022, up to 50 million shares of our common stock could be issued
pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan, of which 6 million shares were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. All
options are fully vested, the last of which will expire by December 2023 if not exercised. Currently, we grant RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs
under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 30, 2022, there were 131 million shares available for future grants.
Subject to certain exceptions, RSUs granted to employees either vest (A) over a four-year period, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on
a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter, or (B) over a three-year period,
subject to continued service, with 40% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 7.5% vesting
quarterly thereafter. PSUs vest over a four-year period, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the
anniversary of the date of grant and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter. Market-based PSUs vest 100% on approximately the three-year anniversary
of the date of grant. However, the number of shares subject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is generally determined
by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of pre-determined criteria.
Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In 2012, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as most recently amended and restated, or the
2012 Plan.
Employees who participate in the 2012 Plan may have up to 15% of their earnings withheld to purchase shares of common stock. The Board may
decrease this percentage at its discretion. Each offering period is approximately 24 months, which is generally divided into four purchase periods of
six months. The price of common stock purchased under our 2012 Plan will be equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common
stock on the commencement date of each offering period or the fair market value of the common stock on each purchase date within the offering. As
of January 30, 2022, we had 233 million shares reserved for future issuance under the 2012 Plan.

Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments
We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses.
These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or
ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021.
We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are
denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the
change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency
denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.
The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021:
January 30, January 31,
2022 2021

As of January 30, 2022, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within eighteen months. The expected realized gains and losses
deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months was not
significant.
During fiscal years 2022 and 2021, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment on other
comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective.
Note 12 - Debt
Long-Term Debt
In June 2021, March 2020, and September 2016, we issued a total of $5.00 billion, $5.00 billion, and $2.00 billion aggregate principal of senior
notes, respectively. The net proceeds from these offerings were $4.98 billion, $4.97 billion, and $1.98 billion, respectively, after deducting debt
discount and issuance costs.
On August 16, 2021, we repaid the $1.00 billion of 2.20% Notes Due 2021.
All of our notes are unsecured senior obligations. All existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the notes. Our notes
pay interest semi-annually. We may redeem each of our notes prior to maturity, subject to a make-whole premium as defined in the applicable form
of note.

Litigation
Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits
The plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on December 21, 2018 in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California, and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint on May 13,
2020. The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the
impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives
who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified
compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may
deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered
judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. Oral argument is scheduled for May 10, 2022.
The putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG,
initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’
appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but stated that
it would reopen the case once the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. The lawsuit asserts claims,
purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate
assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading
statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages
and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures.
The putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Lipchitz
v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending resolution of
the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against
certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information,
corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and
misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified
damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures.
Accounting for Loss Contingencies
As of January 30, 2022, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on
our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these
matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business
and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse
effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.

years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Long-term deferred tax liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
We recognized income tax expense of $189 million, $77 million, and $174 million for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively. Our annual
effective tax rate was 1.9%, 1.7%, and 5.9% for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year
2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to an
74
Table of Contents
NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
increase in the amount of earnings subject to U.S. tax, and a decreased impact of tax benefits from the U.S. federal research tax credit, partially
offset by the benefit of the foreign-derived intangible income deduction and the discrete benefit of the Domestication. The decrease in our effective
tax rate in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject to United
States tax and an increase of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
On June 28, 2021, we simplified our corporate structure by repatriating the economic rights of certain non-U.S. IP to the United States via
domestication of a foreign subsidiary, or the Domestication. The Domestication more closely aligns our corporate structure to our operating structure
in accordance with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting conclusions and changes to
U.S. and European tax laws. The impact of the Domestication, which is regarded as a change in tax status, resulted in a discrete benefit primarily
from re-valuing certain deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, of $244 million in fiscal year 2022.
Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible
income deduction, income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands and Israel, that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal
statutory tax rate, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits and the one-time
benefits of the Domestication.
Our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in
jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate,
recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we completed the acquisition of Mellanox. As a result of the acquisition, we recorded $256 million of
net deferred tax liabilities primarily on the excess of book basis over the tax basis of the acquired intangible assets and undistributed earnings in
certain foreign subsidiaries. We also recorded $153 million of long-term tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox.
As of January 30, 2022, we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $1.05 billion and $232 million of cumulative undistributed earnings held by
certain subsidiaries in Israel and the United Kingdom, respectively. We have not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for
temporary differences related to these investments as the determination of such amount is not practicable.
As of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, we had a valuation allowance of $907 million and $728 million, respectively, related to state and
certain other deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable
income. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income
tax benefits during the period.
As of January 30, 2022, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $397 million, $345 million and $341 million,
respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal year 2023. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $341 million
may be carried forward indefinitely. As of January 30, 2022, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $102 million that will begin to expire
in fiscal year 2042. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $1.24 billion, of which $1.18 billion is attributable to the State of California and
may be carried over indefinitely, and $55 million is attributable to various other states and will begin to expire in fiscal year 2023. Our tax attributes,
net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws, other
authoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances. Utilization of federal, state, and foreign net operating losses and tax credit
carryforwards may also be subject to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar
state and foreign tax provisions. If any such limitations apply, the federal, state, or foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, as
applicable, may expire or be denied before utilization.
As of January 30, 2022, we had $1.01 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $808 million would affect our effective tax rate if
recognized. However, $181 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax positions taken, that, if recognized, would be in
the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that would likely attract a full valuation allowance. The $808 million of net unrecognized tax benefits as
of January 30, 2022 consisted of $670 million recorded in non-current income taxes payable and $138 million reflected as a net reduction to the
deferred tax assets.

A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
January 30, January 31, January 26,
2022 2021 2020
(In millions)
Balance at beginning of period $ 776 $ 583 $ 477
Increases in tax positions for current year 246 158 104
Increases in tax positions for prior years (1) 14 60 7
Decreases in tax positions for prior years (4) (11) —
Settlements (8) (5) —
Lapse in statute of limitations (11) (9) (5)
Balance at end of period $ 1,013 $ 776 $ 583
(1) The fiscal year 2021 balance represents prior year gross unrecognized tax benefits recorded as a result of the Mellanox acquisition.
We classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount refundable, to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for
income taxes within one year. The amount is classified as a long-term liability, or reduction of long-term deferred tax assets or amount refundable, if
we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year.
We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of January 30, 2022, January 31,
2021, and January 26, 2020, we had accrued $59 million, $44 million, and $31 million, respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related
to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not included as a component of our unrecognized tax benefits. As of January 30, 2022, unrecognized tax
benefits of $670 million and the related interest and penalties of $59 million are included in non-current income taxes payable.
While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our
accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised
estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. As of January 30, 2022, we do not believe that our estimates, as
otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.
We are subject to taxation by taxing authorities both in the United States and other countries. As of January 30, 2022, the significant tax jurisdictions
that may be subject to examination include China, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and the United States for fiscal
years 2005 through 2021. As of January 30, 2022, the significant tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under examination include Germany,
India, Israel, and the United States for fiscal years 2005 through 2019.
Note 15 - Shareholders’ Equity
Capital Return Program
Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.
Through January 30, 2022, we have repurchased an aggregate of 1.04 billion shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $7.08
billion. As of January 30, 2022, we have a remaining authorization, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up
to $7.24 billion through December 2022. From January 31, 2022 through March 17, 2022, we repurchased 7.7 million shares of our common stock
for $1.75 billion.
During fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, we paid $399 million, $395 million, and $390 million in cash dividends to our shareholders, respectively.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, our Board of Directors approved the retirement of our existing 349 million treasury shares. These
shares assumed the status of authorized and unissued shares upon retirement. The excess of repurchase price over par value was allocated
between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings, resulting in a reduction in additional paid-in capital by $20 million and retained earnings by
$12.0 billion. Any future repurchased shares will assume the status of authorized and unissued shares.

Note 16 - Employee Retirement Plans
We provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans to eligible employees in the U.S. and certain other countries. Our contribution expense for fiscal
years 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $168 million, $120 million, and $76 million, respectively.
Note 17 - Segment Information
Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an
operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial performance.
Our Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and
solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics; vGPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual
computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems; and Omniverse software for building 3D designs and virtual worlds.
Our Compute & Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; Mellanox networking
and interconnect solutions; automotive AI Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; CMP; Jetson
for robotics and other embedded platforms; and NVIDIA AI Enterprise and other software.
Operating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or expenses that are leveraged
across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments.
The “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Graphics or Compute & Networking for purposes of making
operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and
support costs, acquisition-related costs, IP-related costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in
nature.
Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and amortization expense directly
attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, the CODM does not evaluate depreciation and
amortization expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue. The accounting
policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our reportable
segments and the “All Other” category.

RESTATED
CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION
OF
NVIDIA CORPORATION
I.
The name of this corporation is NVIDIA Corporation.
II.
The address of the registered office of the corporation in the State of Delaware is 251 Little Falls Drive, City of Wilmington, County of New
Castle 19808, and the name of the registered agent of the corporation in the State of Delaware at such address is Corporation Service Company.
III.
The purpose of this corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which a corporation may be organized under the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
IV.
A. This corporation is authorized to issue two classes of stock to be designated, respectively, “Common Stock” and “Preferred Stock.” The
total number of shares which the corporation is authorized to issue is Four Billion Two Million (4,002,000,000) shares. Four Billion (4,000,000,000)
shares shall be Common Stock, each having a par value of one-tenth of one cent ($.001). Two Million (2,000,000) shares shall be Preferred Stock,
each having a par value of one-tenth of one cent ($.001).
The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The Board of Directors is hereby authorized, by filing a
certificate (a “Preferred Stock Designation”) pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, to fix or alter from time to time the designation,
powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of any wholly unissued series of
Preferred Stock, and to establish from time to time the number of shares constituting any such series or any of them; and to increase or decrease
the number of shares of any series subsequent to the issuance of shares of that series, but not below the number of shares of such series then
outstanding. In case the number of shares of any series shall be decreased in accordance with the foregoing sentence, the shares constituting such
decrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series.
V.
For the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and in further definition, limitation and regulation
of the powers of the Corporation, of its directors and of its stockholders or any class thereof, as the case may be, it is further provided that:
A. 1. The management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation shall be vested in its Board of Directors. The
number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be fixed exclusively by one or more resolutions adopted by the Board of
Directors.
2. Subject to the other provisions of this paragraph, the Board of Directors is and shall remain divided into three classes, with the
directors in each class serving for a term expiring at the third annual meeting of stockholders held after their election. Subject to the rights of the
holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the terms of the members of the Board of
Directors shall be as follows: (i) at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2012, the directors whose terms expire at that meeting or such
directors’ successors shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2013; (ii) at the annual
meeting of stockholders to be held in 2013, the directors whose terms expire at that meeting or such directors’ successors shall be elected to hold
office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2014; and (iii) at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2014
and at
1
each annual meeting of stockholders thereafter, all directors shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of
stockholders. The classification of the Board of Directors shall terminate at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2014 and all directors
shall be elected in accordance with clause (iii) above.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article, each director shall serve until his successor is duly elected and qualified or until his
death, resignation or removal. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent
director.
3. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, the Board of Directors or any individual director may be
removed from office at any time (i) with cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all the then outstanding
shares of voting stock of the Corporation, entitled to vote at an election of directors (the “Voting Stock”) or (ii) without cause by the affirmative vote of
the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of Voting Stock.
4. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from
death, resignation, disqualification, removal or other causes and any newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of
directors, shall, unless the Board of Directors determines by resolution that any such vacancies or newly created directorships shall be filled by the
stockholders, except as otherwise provided by law, be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office, even though less
than a quorum of the Board of Directors, and not by the stockholders. Any director elected in accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold
office for the remainder of the full term of the director for which the vacancy was created or occurred and until such director’s successor shall have
been elected and qualified.
5. In the event that Section 2115(a) of the California Corporations Code is applicable to this corporation, then the following shall
apply:
a. Every stockholder entitled to vote in any election of directors of this corporation may cumulate such stockholder’s votes
and give one candidate a number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected multiplied by the number of votes to which the
stockholder’s shares are otherwise entitled, or distribute the stockholder’s votes on the same principle among as many candidates as such
stockholder thinks fit;
b. No stockholder, however, may cumulate such stockholder’s votes for one or more candidates unless (i) the names of
such candidates have been properly placed in nomination, in accordance with the Bylaws of the corporation, prior to the voting, (ii) the stockholder
has given advance notice to the corporation of the intention to cumulative votes pursuant to the Bylaws, and (iii) the stockholder has given proper
notice to the other stockholders at the meeting, prior to voting, of such stockholder’s intention to cumulate such stockholder’s votes; and
c. If any stockholder has given proper notice, all stockholders may cumulate their votes for any candidates who have
been properly placed in nomination. The candidates receiving the highest number of votes of the shares entitled to be voted for them up to the
number of directors to be elected by such shares shall be declared elected.
B. 1. Subject to paragraph (h) of Section 43 of the Bylaws, the Bylaws may be altered or amended or new Bylaws adopted by the
affirmative vote of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of voting stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote at an election of directors (the “Voting Stock”). The Board of Directors shall also have the power to adopt, amend, or
repeal Bylaws.
2. The directors of the Corporation need not be elected by written ballot unless the Bylaws so provide.
3. No action shall be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation except at an annual or special meeting of stockholders called in
accordance with the Bylaws and following the closing of the Initial Public Offering no action shall be taken by the stockholders by written consent.
2
4. Advance notice of stockholder nominations for the election of directors and of business to be brought by stockholders before
any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation shall be given in the manner provided in the Bylaws of the Corporation.
VI.
A. A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach
of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or
omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the Delaware General Corporation Law
is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of
directors, then the liability of a director shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as so
amended.
B. Any repeal or modification of this Article VI shall be prospective and shall not affect the rights under this Article VI in effect at the time of
the alleged occurrence of any act or omission to act giving rise to liability or indemnification.
VII.
A. The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the
manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, except as provided in paragraph B of this Article VII, and all rights conferred upon the stockholders
herein are granted subject to this reservation.
B. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser
vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any particular class or series of the Voting Stock required by law, this
Certificate of Incorporation or any Preferred Stock Designation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-
2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter,
amend or repeal Articles V, VI and VII.

Exhibit 4.7
DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT’S SECURITIES
REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES
EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
NVIDIA Corporation (“we,” “our,” “us,” or the “Company”) has one class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”): our common stock.
DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK
General
The following summary of the terms of our common stock is based upon our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended
and restated bylaws. This summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by express reference to, the
applicable provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, which are filed as exhibits to our Annual
Report on Form 10-K, of which this Exhibit 4.7 is a part, and are incorporated by reference herein. We encourage you to read our restated certificate
of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws, and the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) for more
information.
Our authorized capital stock consists of 4,000,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value, and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001
par value.
Common Stock
The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders. The
holders of common stock are not entitled to cumulative voting rights with respect to the election of directors, and as a consequence, minority
stockholders are not able to elect directors on the basis of their votes alone. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any shares of
preferred stock currently outstanding or issued in the future, holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends as may be
declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available therefor. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of our
common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preference of any then outstanding
preferred stock. Holders of common stock have no preemptive rights and no right to convert their common stock into any other securities. There are
no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock.
Anti-Takeover Effects of Provisions of Delaware Law and Our Charter Documents
Certificate of Incorporation
Stockholders have no cumulative voting rights.
Our certificate of incorporation also requires that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called
annual or special meeting of the stockholders and may not be effected by a consent in writing and that the stockholders may amend our bylaws or
adopt new bylaws only by the affirmative vote of 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting securities. A special meeting of the stockholders may be called
by our Chairman, our Chief Executive Officer or a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors. These provisions may
have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control.
The lack of cumulative voting could make it more difficult for our existing stockholders to replace our board of directors as well as for another party to
obtain control of us by replacing our board of directors. Since our board of directors has the power to retain and discharge our officers, these
provisions could also make it more difficult for existing stockholders or another party to effect a change in management.
These and other provisions may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control or management. These provisions are
intended to enhance the likelihood of continued stability in the composition of our board of directors and in the policies of our board of directors and
to discourage certain types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened change in control. These provisions are designed to reduce our
vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal. The provisions also are intended to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy rights.
However, such provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares and, as a consequence, such
provisions also may inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our shares that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts. Such provisions
also may have the effect of preventing changes in our management.
Section 203 of the DGCL
We are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in a “business
combination” with any “interested stockholder” for a period of three years following the time that such stockholder became an “interested
stockholder,” unless:
• prior to such time, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the
stockholder becoming an interested holder;
• upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder
owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of
determining the number of shares outstanding those shares owned (a) by persons who are directors and also officers and (b) by employee
stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be
tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or
• at or subsequent to such time, the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at an annual or special
meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock which is not
owned by the interested stockholder.
In general, Section 203 of the DGCL defines “business combination” to include the following:
• any merger or consolidation involving the corporation and the interested stockholder;
• any sale, transfer, pledge or other disposition of 10% or more of the assets of the corporation involving the interested stockholder;
• subject to certain exceptions, any transaction that results in the issuance or transfer by the corporation of any stock of the corporation to the
interested stockholder;
• any transaction involving the corporation that has the effect of increasing the proportionate share of the stock or any class or series of the
corporation beneficially owned by the interested stockholder; or
• the receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits provided by or
through the corporation.
In general, Section 203 of the DGCL defines “interested stockholder” as an entity or person beneficially owning 15% or more of the outstanding
voting stock of the corporation and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person.
Certain Transactions
Our bylaws provide that we indemnify our directors and executive officers to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL and any other applicable law.
We are also empowered under our bylaws to indemnify other officers, employees and other agents as set forth in the DGCL or any other applicable
law and to enter into indemnification contracts with our directors and executive officers and to purchase insurance on behalf of any person whom we
are required or permitted to indemnify.
In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that the liability of our directors for monetary damages shall be eliminated to the fullest extent
permissible under Delaware law. Pursuant to Delaware law, our directors shall not be liable for monetary damages for breach of the directors’
fiduciary duty of care to us and our stockholders. However, this provision does not eliminate the duty of care, and in appropriate circumstances,
equitable remedies such as injunctive or other forms of non-monetary relief that will remain available under Delaware law. In addition, each director
will continue to be subject to liability for (1) breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders, (2) acts or omissions not in good faith or
which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (3) violating Section 174 of the DGCL, or (4) any transaction from which the
director derived an improper personal benefit. The provision also does not affect a director’s responsibilities under any other law, such as the federal
securities laws or state or federal environmental laws.
Transfer Agent and Registrar
Computershare is the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock. Computershare’s address is 150 Royall Street, Canton, Massachusetts
02021.
Listing
Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “NVDA”.

Attachment I
NVIDIA Corporation
Amended & Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan
Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement
Pursuant to the Global Restricted Stock Unit Grant Notice (“Grant Notice”) and this Global Restricted Stock Unit
Agreement (including any additional terms and conditions for your country set forth in the appendix attached hereto (the
“Appendix”)) (collectively, the “Agreement”), NVIDIA Corporation (the “Company”) has awarded you a Restricted
Stock Unit Award (the “Award”) under its Amended & Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). This Award is
granted to you effective as of the date of grant set forth in the Grant Notice (the “Date of Grant”). Capitalized terms not
explicitly defined in this Agreement will have the same meanings given to them in the Plan.
1. Grant of the Award. The Award represents the right to be issued on a future date one share of Common
Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit that vests under this Award, subject to the terms and conditions provided in this
Agreement and in the Plan. As of the Date of Grant, the Company will credit to a bookkeeping account maintained by
the Company for your benefit (the “Account”) the number of Restricted Stock Units subject to the Award. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, you will not be required to make any payment to the Company with respect to
your receipt of the Award, the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units or the delivery of the underlying Common Stock.
2. Vesting. Subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement, your Award will vest, if at all, in accordance
with the vesting schedule provided in the Grant Notice, including any special acceleration provisions, as applicable,
contained in the Grant Notice. Vesting will cease upon the termination of your Continuous Service, except if termination
is by reason of death, in which case vesting will accelerate as described in the Grant Notice (and subject to any other
acceleration provided for in the Grant Notice or the Plan). On the termination of your Continuous Service (for any reason
other than death), the Restricted Stock Units credited to the Account that were not vested on the date of such
termination (and are not accelerated pursuant to any acceleration provided for in the Grant Notice or the Plan) will be
forfeited and returned to the Company at no cost to the Company and you will have no further right, title or interest in or
to such Restricted Stock Units or the underlying shares of Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, Continuous
Service during only a period prior to a vesting date (but where Continuous Service has terminated prior to the vesting
date) does not entitle you to vest in a pro-rata portion of the Restricted Stock Units on such date.
3. Number of Restricted Stock Units and Shares of Common Stock.
(a) The number of Restricted Stock Units (and the related shares of Common Stock) subject to your
Award will be adjusted from time to time for Capitalization Adjustments, as provided in the Plan.
(b) Any Restricted Stock Units, shares, cash or other property that become subject to the Award as a
result of a Capitalization Adjustment, if any, will be subject to the same forfeiture restrictions, restrictions on
transferability, and time and manner of delivery as applicable to the other shares covered by your Award.
1.
(c) No fractional shares or rights for fractional shares of Common Stock will be created by this Section 3.
The Board will round down, to the nearest whole share or whole unit of rights, any fractional shares or rights for
fractional shares.
4. Compliance with Law. You will not be issued any shares under your Award unless either (a) the shares are
registered under the Securities Act; or (b) the Company has determined that such issuance would be exempt from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act. Your Award also must comply with other applicable laws and regulations
governing the Award, including any U.S. and non-U.S. state, federal and local laws, and you will not receive such shares
if the Company determines that such receipt would not be in material compliance with such laws and regulations.
5. Limitations on Transfer. Your Award is not transferable, except by will or by the laws of descent and
distribution. In addition to any other limitation on transfer created by applicable securities or other laws, you agree not to
assign, hypothecate, donate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any interest in any of the shares of Common Stock
subject to the Award until the shares are issued to you. After the shares have been issued to you, you are free to assign,
hypothecate, donate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any interest in such shares provided that any such actions are
in compliance with the provisions in this Agreement and applicable securities or other laws. If permitted by the Board
and valid under applicable law, you may, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form satisfactory to the
Company, designate a third party who, in the event of your death, will thereafter be entitled to receive any distribution of
Common Stock to which you were entitled at the time of your death pursuant to this Agreement.
6. Date of Issuance.
(a) The issuance of shares of Common Stock in respect of the Restricted Stock Units is intended to
comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) and will be construed and administered in such a manner to
the extent applicable.
(b) Subject to the satisfaction of any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section
10 of this Agreement), in the event one or more Restricted Stock Units vests, the Company will issue to you, on the
applicable vesting date, one share of Common Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit that vests and such issuance date is
referred to as the “Original Issuance Date.” If the Original Issuance Date falls on a date that is not a business day,
delivery will instead occur on the next following business day.
(c) However, if (i) the Original Issuance Date does not occur (1) during an “open window period”
applicable to you, as determined by the Company in accordance with the Company’s then-effective policy on trading in
Company securities, or (2) on a date when you are otherwise permitted to sell shares of Common Stock on an
established stock exchange or stock market (including but not limited to under a previously established Company-
approved 10b5-1 trading plan), and (ii) the Company elects, prior to the Original Issuance Date, (1) not to satisfy any
withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 below) by withholding shares of Common Stock
from the shares otherwise due, on the Original Issuance Date, to you under this Award, (2) not to permit you to enter
into a “same day sale” commitment with a broker-dealer pursuant to this Agreement (including but not limited to a
commitment under a previously established Company-approved 10b5-1 trading plan) and (3) not to permit you to cover
any withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items (as defined in
2.
Section 10 below) in cash, then the shares that would otherwise be issued to you on the Original Issuance Date will not
be delivered on such Original Issuance Date and will instead be delivered on the first business day when you are not
prohibited from selling shares of the Company’s Common Stock in the open public market, but in no event later than
December 31 of the calendar year in which the Original Issuance Date occurs (that is, the last day of your taxable year
in which the Original Issuance Date occurs), or, if and only if permitted in a manner that complies with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), no later than the date that is the 15th day of the third calendar month of the year
following the year in which the shares of Common Stock under this Award are no longer subject to a “substantial risk of
forfeiture” within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(d). The form of such delivery of the shares
(e.g., a stock certificate or electronic entry evidencing such shares) shall be determined by the Company.
7. Dividends. You will receive no benefit or adjustment to your Award and any unissued shares thereunder with
respect to any cash dividend, stock dividend or other distribution that does not result from a Capitalization Adjustment.
Following the date of vesting, in the event of any cash dividend, stock dividend or other distribution that does not result
from a Capitalization Adjustment, no cash, stock or other property related to such dividend or distribution will be issuable
in respect of your vested Restricted Stock Units.
8. Restrictive Legends. The shares of Common Stock issued under your Award will be endorsed with
appropriate legends if determined by the Company that legends are required under applicable law or otherwise.
9. Award not a Service Contract.
(a) Your Continuous Service with the Company or, if different, the Affiliate that employs you or for which
you otherwise render services (the "Service Recipient") is not for any specified term and, if permitted under applicable
law, may be terminated by you or by the Service Recipient at any time, for any reason, with or without cause and with or
without notice. Nothing in this Agreement (including, but not limited to, the vesting of your Award pursuant to the
schedule set forth in the Grant Notice or the issuance of the shares subject to your Award), the Plan or any covenant of
good faith and fair dealing that may be found implicit in this Agreement or the Plan will: (i) confer upon you any right to
continue in the employ of, or continue an affiliation or other service relationship with the Service Recipient; (ii) constitute
any promise or commitment by the Company, the Service Recipient or any other Affiliate regarding the fact or nature of
future positions, future work assignments, future compensation or any other term or condition of employment or
affiliation; (iii) confer any right or benefit under this Agreement or the Plan unless such right or benefit has specifically
accrued under the terms of this Agreement or Plan; or (iv) deprive the Service Recipient of the right to terminate you at
any time and without regard to any future vesting opportunity that you may have. The grant of the Award shall not be
interpreted as forming or amending an employment or service contract with the Company or the Service Recipient.
(b) By accepting this Award, you acknowledge and agree that the right to continue vesting in the Award is
earned only through Continuous Service (not through the act of being hired, being granted this Award or any other
award or benefit) and that the Company has the right to reorganize, sell, spin-out or otherwise restructure one or more of
its businesses or Affiliates at any time or from time to time, as it deems appropriate (a “reorganization”). You further
acknowledge and agree that such a reorganization could result in the termination of your Continuous Service, or the
3.
termination of Affiliate status of the Service Recipient and the loss of benefits available to you under this Agreement,
including but not limited to, the termination of the right to continue vesting in the Award. You further acknowledge and
agree that this Agreement, the Plan, the transactions contemplated hereunder and the vesting schedule set forth in this
Agreement or any covenant of good faith and fair dealing that may be found implicit in any of them do not constitute an
express or implied promise of continued engagement as an Employee or Consultant for the term of this Agreement, for
any period, or at all, and will not interfere in any way with your right or the right of the Service Recipient to terminate your
Continuous Service at any time, with or without cause and, if permitted under applicable law, with or without notice, and
will not interfere in any way with the Company’s right to conduct a reorganization.
10. Responsibility for Taxes.
(a) You acknowledge that, regardless of any action the Company or the Service Recipient takes with
respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefit tax, payment on account or other tax related
items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you or deemed by the Company or the Service
Recipient, in its discretion, to be an appropriate charge to you even if legally applicable to the Company or the Service
Recipient (“Tax-Related Items”), the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains your responsibility and
may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Service Recipient, if any. You further acknowledge that
the Company and/or the Service Recipient (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any
Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of your Restricted Stock Units or the underlying shares of Common
Stock, including, but not limited to, the grant of the Restricted Stock Units, the vesting and settlement of the Restricted
Stock Units, the delivery or sale of any shares of Common Stock and the issuance of any dividends, and (ii) do not
commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of your Award to reduce or
eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. You acknowledge and agree that you
will not make any claim against the Company, or any of its Officers, Directors, Employees or Affiliates (including the
Service Recipient) for Tax-Related Items arising from your Award. Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in
more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that the Company and/or the Service Recipient may be required to
withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
(b) In connection with the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make
adequate arrangements satisfactorily to the Company, and/or the Service Recipient to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In
this regard, you authorize the Company and/or the Service Recipient, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to
satisfy their withholding obligations or rights, if any, with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the
following: (i) withholding from your wages or any other cash compensation otherwise payable to you; (ii) causing you to
tender a cash payment or requiring you to make a payment in another form acceptable to the Company; (iii) permitting
or requiring you to enter into a “same day sale” commitment with a broker-dealer that is a member of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority (a “FINRA Dealer”) (if required, pursuant to this authorization and without further consent)
whereby you irrevocably elect to sell a portion of the shares to be delivered upon settlement of your Restricted Stock
Units to satisfy the Tax-Related Items and whereby the FINRA Dealer irrevocably commits to forward the proceeds
necessary to satisfy the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items directly to the Company and/or the Service
Recipient, including a commitment pursuant to a previously established Company-approved 10b5-1 plan; (iv)
withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares of
4.
Common Stock issued or otherwise issuable to you upon settlement of the Award with a value equal to the amount of
such withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items or such other amount as may be permitted while still avoiding
classification of the Award as a liability for financial accounting purposes; provided, however that if you are an Officer,
then the Company will withhold a number of shares of Common Stock upon the relevant taxable or tax withholding
event, as applicable, unless the use of such withholding method is not feasible under applicable law or has materially
adverse accounting consequences, as determined by the Board, in its sole discretion, in which case, any withholding
obligation for Tax-Related Items may be satisfied by one or a combination of methods (i)-(iii) above; and/or (v) any other
method of withholding determined by the Company, provided such method is compliant with applicable law and the
Plan.
(c) The Company and/or the Service Recipient may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by
considering statutory or other withholding rates, including maximum rates applicable in your jurisdiction(s). In the event
of over-withholding, you may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash from the Company or the Service
Recipient (with no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent), or if not refunded, you may seek a refund from the local
tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, you may be required to pay any Tax-Related Items directly to the
applicable tax authority or to the Company and/or the Service Recipient. Maximum tax rates are based on the applicable
rates in your country, including your share of payroll or similar taxes, as provided in tax law, regulations, or the tax
authority’s administrative practices, not to exceed the highest rate in that jurisdiction, even if that rate exceeds the
highest rate that may be applicable to you. If any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding
a number of shares of Common Stock, for tax purposes, you will be deemed to have been issued the full number of
shares of Common Stock subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the shares of
Common Stock is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items.
(d) Unless any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied, the Company will have no
obligation to deliver to you any shares of Common Stock or other consideration pursuant to this Award.
(e) In the event any obligation to withhold arises prior to the delivery to you of shares of Common Stock
or it is determined after the delivery of shares of Common Stock to you that the amount of the withholding obligation was
greater than the amount withheld, if anything, you agree to indemnify and hold the Company and/or the Service
Recipient harmless from any failure by the Company and/or the Service Recipient to withhold the proper amount.
11. Nature of Grant. In accepting your Award, you acknowledge, understand and agree that:
(a) the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and it may be
modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, to the extent permitted by the Plan;

of your employment agreement, if any);
(k) unless otherwise provided herein, in the Plan or by the Company in its discretion, the Award and the
benefits evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the Award or any such benefits transferred
to, or assumed by, another company nor to be exchanged, cashed out or substituted for, in connection with any
corporate transaction affecting the shares of Common Stock;
(l) unless otherwise agreed with the Company in writing, the Award and the shares of Common Stock
subject to the Award, and the income from and value of same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection
with, the service you may provide as a director of an Affiliate; and

regarding your participation in the Plan, and by accepting this Award, you have agreed that you have done so or
knowingly and voluntarily declined to do so.
13. Unsecured Obligation. Your Award is unfunded, and as a holder of an Award, you will be considered an
unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to the Company’s obligation, if any, to issue shares pursuant to this
Agreement upon vesting of the Award. You will not have voting or any other rights as a stockholder of the Company with
respect to the shares to be issued pursuant to this Agreement until such shares are issued to you. Upon such issuance,
you will obtain full voting and other rights as a stockholder of the Company. Nothing contained in this Agreement, and no
action taken pursuant to its provisions, will create or be construed to create a trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship
between you and the Company or any other person.
14. Other Documents. You hereby acknowledge receipt or the right to receive a document providing the
information required by Rule 428(b)(1) promulgated under the Securities Act, which includes the Plan prospectus. In
addition, you acknowledge receipt of the Company’s policy permitting certain individuals to sell shares only during
certain “window” periods and the Company’s insider trading policy, in effect from time to time and understand that this
policy applies to shares received under this Award.
15. Notices; Electronic Delivery/Acceptance. Any notices provided for in your Award or the Plan will be given
in writing and will be deemed effectively given upon receipt or, in the case of notices delivered by the Company to you,
five (5) days after deposit in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to you at the last address you provided
to the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any
documents and transmit or require you to transmit notices related to participation in the Plan and this Award by
electronic means. You hereby consent to receive such documents and notices, and to give such notices, by electronic
delivery and to participate in the Plan through the on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the
Company or a third party designated by the Company from time to time.
16. Governing Plan Document/Recoupment. Your Award is subject to all the provisions of the Plan, the
provisions of which are hereby made a part of your Award, and is further subject to all interpretations, amendments,
rules and regulations which may from time to time be promulgated and adopted pursuant to the Plan. In addition, this

Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and any implementing regulations thereunder, any clawback policy adopted
by the Company and any compensation recovery policy otherwise required by applicable law.
17. Language. You acknowledge that you are sufficiently proficient in the English language, or have consulted
with an advisor who is sufficiently proficient in
7.
English, so as to allow you to understand the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Further, if you have received this
Agreement or any other document related to the Plan translated into a language other than English and if the meaning
of the translated version is different than the English version, the English version will control.
18. Insider Trading Restrictions/Market Abuse Laws. You may be subject to insider trading restrictions
and/or market abuse laws based on the exchange on which the shares of Common Stock are listed and in applicable
jurisdictions, including the United States and your country or your broker’s country, if different, which may affect your
ability to accept, acquire, sell or otherwise dispose of shares of Common Stock, rights to shares of Common Stock (e.g.,
Restricted Stock Units) or rights linked to the value of shares of Common Stock during such times as you are considered
to have “inside information” regarding the Company (as defined by the laws in applicable jurisdictions). Local insider
trading laws and regulations may prohibit the cancellation or amendment of orders you placed before you possessed
inside information. Furthermore, you could be prohibited from (i) disclosing the inside information to any third party,
which may include fellow employees and (ii) “tipping” third parties or causing them otherwise to buy or sell securities.
Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate from and in addition to any restrictions that may be
imposed under any applicable insider trading policy of the Company. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to
comply with any applicable restrictions and you should speak with your personal legal advisor on this matter.
19. Foreign Assets/Account and Tax Reporting, Exchange Controls. Your country may have certain foreign
asset, account and/or tax reporting requirements and exchange controls which may affect your ability to acquire or hold
shares of Common Stock under the Plan or cash received from participating in the Plan (including from any dividends
received or sale proceeds arising from the sale of shares of Common Stock) in a brokerage or bank account outside
your country. You understand that you may be required to report such accounts, assets or transactions to the tax or
other authorities in your country. You also may be required to repatriate sale proceeds or other funds received as a
result of participation in the Plan to your country through a designated bank or broker and/or within a certain time after
receipt. In addition, you may be subject to tax payment and/or reporting obligations in connection with any income
realized under the Plan and/or from the sale of shares of Common Stock. You acknowledge that you are responsible for
complying with all such requirements, and that you should consult personal legal and tax advisors, as applicable, to
ensure compliance.
20. Appendix. Notwithstanding any provisions in this Agreement, your Award shall be subject to the additional
terms and conditions for your country set forth in the Appendix attached hereto as Attachment II. Moreover, if you
relocate to one of the countries included therein, the terms and conditions for such country will apply to you to the extent
the Company determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable for legal or
administrative reasons. The Appendix constitutes part of this Agreement.
21. Imposition of Other Requirements. The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on your
participation in the Plan, on the Award and on any shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan, to the extent the
Company determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons.
22. Severability. If all or any part of this Agreement or the Plan is declared by any court or governmental
authority to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or
8.
invalidity will not invalidate any portion of this Agreement or the Plan not declared to be unlawful or invalid. Any Section
of this Agreement (or part of such a Section) so declared to be unlawful or invalid will, if possible, be construed in a
manner which will give effect to the terms of such Section or part of a Section to the fullest extent possible while
remaining lawful and valid.
23. Governing Law/Venue. The interpretation, performance and enforcement of this Agreement will be
governed by the law of the state of Delaware without regard to such state’s conflicts of laws rules. For purposes of
litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from the relationship of the parties evidenced by this grant or the
Agreement, the parties hereby submit to and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree
that such litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of Santa Clara County, California, or the federal courts for the
United States for the Northern District of California, and no other courts, where this grant is made and/or to be
performed.
24. Miscellaneous.
(a) The rights and obligations of the Company under your Award will be transferable to any one or more
persons or entities, and all covenants and agreements hereunder will inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the
Company’s successors and assigns. Your rights and obligations under your Award may only be assigned with the prior
written consent of the Company.
(b) You agree upon request to execute any further documents or instruments necessary or desirable in
the sole determination of the Company to carry out the purposes or intent of your Award.
(c) You acknowledge and agree that you have reviewed your Award in its entirety, have had an
opportunity to obtain the advice of counsel prior to executing and accepting your Award, and fully understand all
provisions of your Award.
(d) All obligations of the Company under the Plan and this Agreement will be binding on any successor to
the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger,
consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company.
25. Amendment. Subject to Section 21 above, this Agreement may not be modified, amended or terminated
except by an instrument in writing, signed by you and by a duly authorized representative of the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended solely by the Board by a writing which specifically
states that it is amending this Agreement, so long as a copy of such amendment is delivered to you, and provided that
no such amendment adversely affecting your rights hereunder may be made without your written consent. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Board reserves the right to change, by written notice to you, the provisions of this Agreement
in any way it may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purpose of the grant as a result of any change in
applicable laws or regulations or any future law, regulation, ruling, or judicial decision, provided that any such change
will be applicable only to rights relating to that portion of the Award which is then subject to restrictions as provided in
this Agreement.
26. Compliance with Section 409A of the Code. This Award is intended to comply with U.S. Treasury
Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) and thus to not be treated as “deferred compensation”, and will be construed and
administered in
9.
such a manner, and any ambiguous or missing terms that may otherwise be supplied from and/or defined under Code
Section 409A in a manner that fulfills such intention hereby incorporated by reference. Each installment of Restricted
Stock Units that vests hereunder is intended to constitute a “separate payment” for purposes of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if it is determined that the Award fails to satisfy the requirements
of the short-term deferral rule and is otherwise not exempt from, and determined to be deferred compensation subject to
Code Section 409A, this Award shall comply with Code Section 409A to the extent necessary to avoid adverse personal
tax consequences and any ambiguities herein shall be interpreted accordingly. If it is determined that the Award is
deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A and you are a “specified employee” (as determined under Code
Section 409A) on your Separation from Service, then the issuance of any shares, cash or other property that would
otherwise be made on the date of your Separation from Service (or within the first six months thereafter as a result of
your Separation from Service) will not be made on the originally scheduled date(s) and will instead be issued in a lump
sum on the date that is six months and one day after the date of the Separation from Service, but if and only if such
delay in the issuance is necessary to avoid the imposition of taxation on you in respect of the shares, cash or property
under Code Section 409A.

Attachment II
Appendix to
NVIDIA Corporation
Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement
Additional Terms and Conditions For Non-U.S. Participants
Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Appendix have the meanings set forth in the Plan, in the Global Restricted
Stock Unit Grant Notice and/or in the Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement.
Terms and Conditions
This Appendix includes additional terms and conditions that govern the Restricted Stock Units granted to you under the
Plan if you reside and/or work in one of the countries listed below. If you are a citizen or resident (or are considered as
such for local law purposes) of a country other than the country in which you are currently residing and/or working, or if
you relocate to another country after the grant of the Restricted Stock Units, the Company shall, in its discretion,
determine to what extent the additional terms and conditions contained herein shall be applicable to you.
Notifications
This Appendix may also include information regarding exchange controls and certain other issues of which you should
be aware with respect to your participation in the Plan. The information is based on the securities, exchange control and
other laws in effect in the respective countries as of January 2022. Such laws are often complex and change frequently.
As a result, the Company strongly recommends that you not rely on the information in this Appendix as the only source
of information relating to the consequences of your participation in the Plan because the information may be out of date
at the time the Restricted Stock Units vest, shares of Common Stock are issued upon vesting, dividends are paid on
shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan, or you sell shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan.
In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and the
Company is not in a position to assure you of a particular result. Accordingly, you are advised to seek appropriate
professional advice as to how the relevant laws in your country may apply to your situation.
Finally, if you are a citizen or resident (or are considered as such for local law purposes) of a country other than the
country in which you are currently residing and/or working, or if you relocate to another country after the grant of the
Restricted Stock Units, the notifications contained herein may not be applicable to you in the same manner.

certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone
number, email address, date of birth, social insurance, passport or other identification number, salary,
nationality, job title, any shares of Common Stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all Restricted
Stock Units or any other entitlement to shares of Common Stock or equivalent benefits awarded, canceled,
exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor (“Data”), for the purposes of implementing,
administering and managing the Plan. The legal basis, where required, for the processing of Data is your
consent.
(b) Stock Plan Administration Service Providers. The Company transfers Data to Charles Schwab
& Co., Inc. (including certain of its affiliated companies) (collectively, “Schwab”), which is assisting the
Company with the implementation, administration and management of your participation in the Plan. The
Company may select different or additional service providers in the future and share Data with such other
provider(s) serving in a similar manner. You may be asked to agree on separate terms and data processing
practices with Schwab, with such agreement being a condition to the ability to participate in the Plan.
(c) International Data Transfers. The Company and Schwab are based in the United States. Your
country or jurisdiction may have different data privacy laws and protections than the United States. The

regulatory obligations, including under tax, exchange control, labor and securities laws. This period may extend
beyond your period of Continuous Service. When the Company or the Service Recipient no longer need Data for
any of the above purposes, they will cease processing it in this context and remove it from all of their systems
used for such purposes, to the fullest extent possible.
(e) Voluntariness and Consequences of Consent Denial or Withdrawal. Participation in the Plan is
voluntary, and you are providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis. If you do not consent, or if
you later seek to revoke your consent, your salary or other cash compensation from your employment or other
service with the Service Recipient will not be affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing
consent is that the Company would not be able to grant the Restricted Stock Units or other equity awards to
you or administer or maintain such awards.
(f) Data Subject Rights. You may have a number of rights under data privacy laws in your
jurisdiction. Depending on where you are based, such rights may include the right to (i) request access or
copies of Data the Company processes, (ii) rectification of incorrect Data, (iii) deletion of Data, (iv) restrictions
12.
on processing of Data, (v) portability of Data, (vi) lodge complaints with competent authorities in your

privacy consent. If applicable, you agree that upon request of the Company or the Service Recipient, you will
provide an executed acknowledgement or data privacy consent form (or any other agreements or consents)
that the Company and/or the Service Recipient may deem necessary to obtain from you for the purpose of
administering your participation in the Plan in compliance with the data privacy laws in your country, either now
or in the future. You understand and agree that you will not be able to participate in the Plan if you fail to
provide any such consent or agreement requested by the Company and/or the Service Recipient.
Data Privacy Notification For Participants Working and/or Residing In the European Union ("EU")/European
Economic Area ("EEA")/Switzerland/United Kingdom.
The Company collects, processes, uses and transfers certain personally-identifiable information about you for
the exclusive legitimate purpose of granting Restricted Stock Units and implementing, administering and
managing your participation in the Plan. Specifics of the data processing are described below.
(a) Purposes and Legal Bases of Processing. The Company processes the Personal Data (as defined
below) for the purpose of performing its contractual obligations under this Agreement, granting Restricted
Stock Units, implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan and facilitating
compliance with applicable tax, exchange control, securities and labor law. The legal basis for the processing
of the Personal Data (as defined below) by the Company and the third-party service providers described below
is the necessity of the data processing for the Company to perform its contractual obligations under this
Agreement and for the Company’s legitimate business interests of managing the Plan and generally
administering employee equity awards.
(b) Personal Data Subject to Processing. The Company collects, processes and uses the following
types of personal data about you: your name, home address, email address, date of birth, social insurance,
passport number or other identification number, any shares of Common Stock or directorships held in the
Company, details of all Restricted Stock Units or any other entitlement to shares of Common Stock awarded,
canceled, settled, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor, which the Company receives from you or the
Service Recipient (“Personal Data”).
(c) Stock Plan Administration Service Providers. The Company transfers Personal Data to Charles
Schwab & Co., Inc. and certain of its affiliated companies (“Schwab”), an independent stock plan administrator
with operations, relevant to the Company, in the United States, which assists the Company with the
implementation, administration and management of the Plan. In the future, the Company may select different
service providers and may share Personal Data
13.
with such service providers. Schwab will open an account for you to receive and trade shares of Common
Stock. You will be asked to agree on separate terms and data processing practices with Schwab, which is a
condition of your ability to participate in the Plan. Your Personal Data will only be accessible by those
individuals requiring access to it for purposes of implementing, administering and operating your participation
in the Plan. You understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential
recipients of Personal Data by contacting your local human resources manager.
(d) Other Recipients. The Company may further transfer Personal Data to other third party service
providers, if necessary to ensure compliance with applicable tax, exchange control, securities and labor law.
Such third party service providers may include the Company’s outside legal counsel as well as the Company’s
auditor. Wherever possible, the Company will anonymize data, but you understand that your Personal Data may
need to be transferred to such providers to ensure compliance with applicable law and/or tax requirements.
(e) International Data Transfers. The Company and its service providers, including, without
limitation, Schwab, operate, relevant to the Company, in the United States, which means that it will be
necessary for Personal Data to be transferred to, and processed in, the United States. You understand and
acknowledge that the United States is not subject to an unlimited adequacy finding by the European
Commission and that your Personal Data may not have an equivalent level of protection as compared to your
country of residence.
When the Company transfers your Personal Data, it will ensure that this transfer complies with
applicable laws and legislation. The Company has Model Clauses in place for the collection, use, and retention
of Personal Data transferred from the EU, EEA, Switzerland and the United Kingdom to other countries, and
also complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S Privacy Shield Framework. The
Company is certified to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks and the commitments they
entail, although the Company does not rely on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as a legal basis for
transfers of Personal Data in light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the EU in Case C-311/18.
The Company complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield
Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of
Personal Data transferred from the EU, EEA, Switzerland and the United Kingdom to the United States. The
Company has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If third-
party agents process Personal Data on the Company’s behalf in a manner inconsistent with the Principles of
either Privacy Shield Framework or the Model Clauses, the Company remains liable unless it proves it is not
responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
If there is any conflict between the terms in this Agreement and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy
Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view the Company’s
certification, please visit www.privacyshield.gov.
(f) Data Retention. The Company will use the Personal Data only as long as necessary to implement,
administer and manage your participation in the Plan, or as required to comply with legal or regulatory
obligations, including tax,
14.
exchange control, labor and securities laws. This period may extend beyond your period of Continuous Service.
When the Company or the Service Recipient no longer need Data for any of the above purposes, they will cease
processing it in this context and remove it from all of their systems used for such purposes, to the fullest extent
possible.
(g) Data Subject Rights. To the extent provided by law, you have the right to:
i. Request access to and obtain a copy of your Personal Data;
ii. Request rectification (or correction) of Personal Data that is inaccurate;
iii. Request erasure (or deletion) of Personal Data that is no longer necessary to fulfill the
purposes for which it was collected, or does not need to be retained by the Company for
other legitimate purposes;
iv. Restrict or object to the processing of your Personal Data; and
v. If applicable, request your Personal Data be ported (transferred) to another company.
Subject to the applicable data protection laws, application of the above rights may vary depending on the
type of data involved, and the Company’s particular basis for processing the Personal Data.
To make a request to exercise one of the above rights, you can contact your local HR representative. The
Company will consider and act upon any requests in accordance with applicable data protection laws. The
Company may request specific information from you to enable it to confirm your identity and right to access, as
well as to search for and provide you with the Personal Data that it holds about you.
(h) Contractual Requirement. Your provision of Personal Data and its processing as described above
is a contractual requirement and a condition to your ability to participate in the Plan. You understand that, as a
consequence of you refusing to provide Personal Data, the Company may not be able to allow you to
participate in the Plan, grant Restricted Stock Units to you or administer or maintain such Restricted Stock
Units. However, your participation in the Plan is purely voluntary. While you will not receive Restricted Stock
Units if you decide against participating in the Plan or providing Personal Data as described above, your
employment or other service and your salary or other cash compensation will not be affected in any way. For
more information on the consequences of the refusal to provide Personal Data, you may contact your local HR
representative.
(i) How to Contact Us. For copies of additional privacy documents mentioned in this Agreement, or if
you have privacy concerns or questions related to this Agreement, you may contact your local HR
representative.

notices and legal proceedings entered into, given or instituted pursuant hereto or relating directly or indirectly hereto, be
drawn up in English.
Les parties reconnaissent avoir exigé la rédaction en anglais de cette convention (“Agreement”), ainsi que de tous

Data Privacy. This provision supplements the Data Privacy Consent For Participants Working and/or Residing Outside
the European Union/European Economic Area/Switzerland/United Kingdom provision of this Appendix:
You hereby authorize the Company and the Company’s representatives to discuss with and obtain all relevant
information from all personnel, professional or not, involved in the

administration and operation of the Plan. You further authorize the Company, the Service Recipient and/or any other
Affiliate to disclose and discuss such information with their advisors. You also authorize the Company, the Service
Recipient and/or any other Affiliate to record such information and to keep such information in your employee file.
Notifications
Securities Law Information. You are permitted to sell shares of Common Stock acquired through the Plan through the
designated broker appointed by the Company provided the resale of such shares takes place outside of Canada and
through the facilities of a stock exchange, which should be the case because the Common Stock is currently listed on
the Nasdaq Global Select Market.
Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information. Specified Foreign property, including Restricted Stock Units, shares of
Common Stock acquired under the Plan and other rights to receive shares (e.g., options) of a non-Canadian company,
held by a Canadian resident must generally be reported annually on a Form T1135 (Foreign Income Verification
Statement) if the total cost of the specified foreign property exceeds C$100,000 at any time during the year. Restricted
Stock Units must be reported – generally at a nil cost – if the C$100,000 cost threshold is exceeded because other
specified foreign property is held by you. When shares of Common Stock are acquired, their cost generally is the
adjusted cost base (“ACB”) of the shares. The ACB would ordinarily equal the fair market value of the shares at the time
of acquisition, but if you own other shares of the same company, this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the
other shares. You should consult with your personal tax advisor to determine your reporting requirements.
CHINA
Terms and Conditions
The following provisions apply to you if you are subject to exchange control regulations in the People’s Republic of
China (“China”), including the requirements imposed by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”), as
determined by the Company in its sole discretion:
Settlement of Award and Sale of Shares. This provision supplements Section 6 of the Global Restricted Stock Unit
Agreement:
You will not be permitted to vest in any shares of Common Stock unless and until the necessary approvals for the Plan
have been obtained from SAFE and remain in place, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. Further, the
Company is under no obligation to issue shares of Common Stock if the Company has not or does not obtain SAFE
approval or if any such SAFE approval subsequently becomes invalid or ceases to be in effect by the time you vest in
the Restricted Stock Units.
To facilitate compliance with regulatory requirements in China, you understand and agree that any shares of Common
Stock you acquire upon vesting of your Restricted Stock Units may be immediately sold at vesting or, at the Company’s
discretion, at a later time. You agree that the Company is authorized to instruct its designated broker to assist with the
sale of such shares of Common Stock (on your behalf pursuant to this authorization and without further consent) and
you expressly authorize the designated broker to complete the sale of such shares. You acknowledge that the
designated
18.
broker is under no obligation to arrange for the sale of the shares of Common Stock at any particular price. Upon the
sale of the shares of Common Stock, the Company agrees to pay the cash proceeds from the sale, less any brokerage
fees or commissions, to you in accordance with applicable exchange control laws and regulations and provided any
withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items resulting from your participation in the Plan has been satisfied.
If the Company, in its discretion, does not exercise its right to require the sale of shares of Common Stock upon vesting,
as described in the preceding paragraph, and your Continuous Service terminates, you understand and agree to sell any
shares acquired pursuant to your Award within 90 days after your termination date, or within such other period as
determined by the Company and in compliance with applicable law. You further agree that if you do not sell these
shares within 90 days after your termination date (or such other period as determined by the Company and in
compliance with applicable law), the Company is authorized to instruct its designated broker to assist with the
mandatory sale of such shares (on your behalf pursuant to this authorization and without further consent) and you
expressly authorize the Company’s designated broker to complete the sale of such shares. You acknowledge that the
Company’s designated broker is under no obligation to arrange for the sale of the shares at any particular price. Upon
the sale of the shares, the Company agrees to pay you the cash proceeds from the sale of the shares, less any
brokerage fees or commissions and subject to satisfaction of any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items.
Any payment of proceeds related to your Award and/or the shares of Common Stock underlying the Award will have to
be effectuated through a special exchange control account established by the Company or an Affiliate in China. If the
funds are converted into local currency, neither the Company nor any Affiliate will bear the exchange rate risk and does
not undertake to convert the funds at any particular time or at any particular rate.
Restriction on Transfer of Shares. As a condition of vesting of the Award, you acknowledge and agree that any shares of
Common Stock that you may acquire under the Plan must be held in the account established for you under the Plan until
such time as you decide or are required to sell the shares. The shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan may
not be transferred, assigned or pledged (other than pursuant to a sale of such shares effected through the Plan’s
designated broker) to any other person, broker or other entity at any time.
Exchange Control Requirements. You understand and agree that you will not be permitted to transfer any shares of
Common Stock acquired under the Plan out of the account established for you with the Company’s designated broker
and that you will be required to immediately repatriate to China any cash proceeds from the sale of the shares of
Common Stock acquired under the Plan or from dividends paid on such shares. You further understand that such
repatriation of cash proceeds will need to be effectuated through a special exchange control account established by the
Company or an Affiliate in China, and you hereby consent and agree that any proceeds from the sale of shares of
Common Stock or dividends paid on such shares may be transferred to such special account prior to being delivered to
you.
The proceeds may be paid to you in U.S. dollars or local currency at the Company’s discretion. In the event the
proceeds are paid in U.S. dollars, you understand that you will be required to set up a U.S. dollar bank account in China
and provide the bank account details to the Service Recipient and/or the Company, so that the proceeds may be
deposited into this account. If the proceeds are paid in local currency, you agree to
19.
bear any exchange rate risk between the time the shares of Common Stock are sold or dividends on such shares are
paid and the time the proceeds are distributed to you through any such special account.
You agree to comply with any other requirements that may be imposed by the Company in the future in order to facilitate
compliance with exchange control requirements in China.
CZECH REPUBLIC
Notifications
Exchange Control Information. The Czech National Bank (“CNB”) may require you to fulfill certain notification duties in

notice, you should consult your personal legal advisor prior to vesting to ensure compliance with current regulations. It is
your responsibility to comply with applicable Czech exchange control laws.

SPAIN
Terms and Conditions
Nature of Grant. The following provision supplements Section 11 of the Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement:
By accepting the Award, you consent to participation in the Plan and acknowledge that you have received a copy of the
Plan.
You understand that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and in its sole discretion decided to grant an Award
under the Plan to individuals who may be Consultants, Directors, or Employees of the Service Recipient, the Company,
or one of its other Affiliates throughout the world. The decision is limited and entered into based upon the express
assumption and condition that any Award will not economically or otherwise bind the Company or any Affiliate, including
the Service Recipient, on an ongoing basis, other than as expressly set forth in the Agreement. Consequently, you
understand that the Award is given on the assumption and condition that the Award shall not become part of any
employment or other service contract (whether with the Company or any Affiliate, including the Service Recipient) and
shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purpose (including severance compensation) or any other
right whatsoever. Furthermore, you understand and freely accept that there is no guarantee that any benefit whatsoever
shall arise from the Award, which is gratuitous and discretionary, since the future value of the Award, and the underlying
shares of Common Stock, is unknown and unpredictable.
Further, your participation in the Plan is expressly conditioned on your continued and active rendering of service, such
that, unless otherwise set forth in the Plan, if your Continuous Service terminates for any reason except for your death,
your participation in the Plan will cease immediately. This will be the case, for example, even if (1) you are considered to
be unfairly dismissed without good cause (i.e., subject to a “despido improcedente”); (2) you are dismissed for
disciplinary or objective reasons or due to a
38.
collective dismissal; (3) your Continuous Service ceases due to a change of work location, duties or any other
employment or contractual condition; (4) your Continuous Service ceases due to a unilateral breach of contract by the
Company or any of its Affiliates; or (5) your Continuous Service terminates for any other reason whatsoever.
Consequently, upon termination of your Continuous Service for any of the above reasons, you automatically lose any
right to participate in the Plan on the date of your termination of Continuous Service, as described in the Plan and the
Agreement.
Notifications
Securities Law Information. The Award and shares of Common Stock described in the Agreement do not qualify under
Spanish regulations as securities. No “offer of securities to the public”, as defined under Spanish law, has taken place
or will take place in the Spanish territory. The Agreement has not been nor will it be registered with the Comisión
Nacional del Mercado de Valores, and does not constitute a public offering prospectus.
Exchange Control Information. The acquisition of shares of Common Stock and subsequent sales of shares of Common
Stock must be declared for statistical purposes to the Dirección General de Comercio e Inversiones (the “DGCI”).
Because you will not purchase or sell the shares of Common Stock through the use of a Spanish financial institution,
you will need to make the declaration yourself by filing a D-6 form with the DGCI. Generally, the D-6 form must be filed
each January while the shares of Common Stock are owned. However, if the value of the shares of Common Stock
acquired under the Plan or the amount of the sale proceeds exceeds €1,502,530, the declaration must be filed within
one month of the acquisition or sale, as applicable.
In addition, any securities accounts (including brokerage accounts held abroad), as well as the securities (including
shares of Common Stock) held in such accounts, may need to be declared electronically to the Bank of Spain,
depending on the value of the transactions during the prior tax year or the balances in such accounts as of December 31
of the prior tax year.
Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information. Rights or assets (e.g., shares of Common Stock or cash held in a bank or
brokerage account) held outside of Spain with a value in excess of €50,000 per type of right or asset (e.g., shares of
Common Stock, cash, etc.) as of December 31, must be reported on your annual tax return. After such rights and/or
assets are initially reported, the reporting obligation will only apply for subsequent years if the value of any previously-
reported rights or assets increases by more than €20,000. Shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan or other
equity programs offered by the Company constitute assets for purposes of this requirement, but unvested rights (e.g.,
Restricted Stock Units, etc.) are not considered assets or rights for purposes of this requirement.
