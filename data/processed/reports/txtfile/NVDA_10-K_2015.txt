Extending our visual computing leadership into mobile and cloud-computing platforms. We believe that visual computing will remain a
key component in the computing paradigm circumscribed by mobile, cloud and software as a service. We enable interactive graphics
applications - such as games, movie and photo editing and design software - to be accessed by any device, anywhere. We believe that the
user experience in virtual desktop infrastructures should be indistinguishable from physical environments and, accordingly, leverage our
research and development resources to create differentiated devices and products that deliver this capability.
Revolutionizing computing with the GPU’s parallel processing capability. We believe that the massively parallel processing capabilities of
NVIDIA GPUs can solve complex computational problems in significantly less time and with less power consumption than a CPU. We
work with developers worldwide who write programs for the CUDA platform using various high-level programming languages. Developers
are able to accelerate applications in areas ranging from molecular dynamics to image processing, derivatives modeling for financial risk
analysis and big-data analytics.
Protecting our intellectual property, and using it to enter into license and development contracts. We believe our intellectual property
portfolio is a valuable asset that can be monetized by licensing our technology to customers that desire to build such capabilities directly into
their own products. Such license and development arrangements can further enhance the reach of our graphics and mobile technology.
Enabling visual computing platforms in key focus areas. We believe that we are well positioned to use our expertise in visual and parallel
computing to make contributions in four key markets where our visual computing expertise is valued:
- Gaming : Our strategy is to use advanced graphics technologies to create a range of gaming platforms, stretching across PCs,
mobile devices and the cloud.
- Enterprise : Our strategy is to serve as our customers' most trusted graphics partner, working closely with independent software
vendors to optimize their offerings for NVIDIA GPUs.

Sales and Marketing
Our worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to our objective of providing markets with our high-performance and efficient GPUs and
mobile SOC products. Our sales and marketing teams work closely with each industry's respective OEMs, original design manufacturers, or ODMs,
system builders, motherboard manufacturers, add-in board manufacturers, or AIBs, retailers/distributors and industry trendsetters, collectively
referred to as our Channel, to define product features, performance, price and timing of new products. Members of our sales team have a high level of
technical expertise and product and industry knowledge to support the competitive and complex design win process. We also employ a highly skilled
team of application engineers to assist our Channel in designing, testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products. We believe that
the depth and quality of our design support are keys to improving our Channel's time-to-market, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction
within our Channel and fostering relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products.
As a result of our Channel strategy, a small number of our customers represent the majority of our revenue. However, their end customers
consist of a large number of OEMs and system builders throughout the world. Sales to our largest customer accounted for 11% of our total revenue
for fiscal year 2015.
Additionally, to encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized for platforms utilizing our products and
enterprise applications optimized for our GPUs, we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community.
Engineering and marketing personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss our products, as well as to ascertain
product requirements and solve technical problems. Our developer program makes certain that our products are available to developers prior to
volume availability in order to encourage the development of software applications and game titles that are optimized for our products.

Backlog
Our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders. The quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment
schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers' requirements and in manufacturing availability. The semiconductor
industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules. In light of industry practice and experience, we believe that only a
small portion of our backlog is non-cancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable portion is not significant.
Seasonality
Our GPU and Tegra processor products serve many markets from consumer PC gaming to enterprise workstations to government and service
provider cloud datacenters; however, a majority of our revenue is consumer focused. Our consumer products have typically seen stronger revenue in
the second half of our fiscal year. However, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue.
Manufacturing
We do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products. Instead, we utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing
strategy for all of our product-line operating segments whereby we employ world-class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process,
including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging. This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the
International Organization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability and testing. In
addition, this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations. Our
suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products. As a result, we can focus our
resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing and customer support.
We utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, to
produce our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., BYD Auto Co.
Ltd., Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., JSI Logistics Ltd., King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd. and Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd. to
perform assembly, testing and packaging of most of our products. We purchase substrates from IbidenCo., Ltd., Nanya Technology Corporation, and
Unimicron Technology Corporation.
We typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and then ship the semiconductors to
contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs, distributors, motherboard and AIB customers from our third-party warehouse in Hong Kong. Generally,
these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications, and then ship our products to retailers, system
builders or OEMs as motherboard and add-in board solutions.
Working Capital
We focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other working-capital-related items. We manage inventories by
communicating with our customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a product-by-product basis. We then place
manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand. The quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as
shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers' requirements and in manufacturing availability. We generally
maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery
schedules. A substantial amount of our inventories are maintained as semi-finished products that can be leveraged across a wide range of our
processors to balance our customer demands.
Our existing cash and marketable securities balances decreased by 1.0% to $4.62 billion at the end of fiscal year 2015 compared with the end of
fiscal year 2014. We believe that these balances and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating, acquisition,
capital purchases and intended capital return to shareholders needs for at least the next twelve months.

Table of Contents
Research and Development
We believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading visual computing technology including 3D
graphics, HD video, audio, ultra-low power consumption and SOC architectures is essential to our future success. Our research and development
strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of GPUs and Tegra Processors, including GPUs for high-performance
computing, and Tegra SOCs for SHIELD and other mobile products using independent design teams. Our research and development efforts are
performed within specialized groups consisting of software engineering, hardware engineering, very large scale integration design engineering,
process engineering, architecture and algorithms. These groups act as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple
generations of products.
A critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computer-aided design industry. We invest
significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders, often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new
products. We believe that forming these relationships and utilizing next-generation development tools to design, simulate and verify our products will
help us remain at the forefront of the 3D graphics market and develop products that utilize leading-edge technology on a rapid basis. We believe this
approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of PC OEMs and other manufacturers. We believe in leveraging our significant research and
development depth and scale to create differentiated products.
As of January 25, 2015 , we had 6,658 full-time employees engaged in research and development. During fiscal years 2015 , 2014 and 2013, we
incurred research and development expense of $ 1.36 billion , $1.34 billion and $ 1.15 billion , respectively.
Competition
The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and
declining average selling prices. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access
to customers and distribution channels, software support, conformity to industry standard Application Programming Interfaces, manufacturing
capabilities, processor pricing and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to
anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable
levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products
that may be less costly than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible
that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share .
A significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs and mobile SOC products. Some of our
competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer
or technological changes.
Our current competitors include:
• suppliers of discrete and integrated GPUs, including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their
existing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;
• suppliers of SOC products that are embedded into smart devices such as televisions, monitors, set-top boxes, gaming devices and
automobiles, such as AMD, Apple, Inc., Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Fuzhou Rockchip Electronics Co., Ltd., Intel, Marvell Technology
Group Ltd., Mediatek, Mobileye N.V., Qualcomm Incorporated, Samsung, ST Microelectronics, and Texas Instruments Incorporated; and
• licensors of graphics technologies, such as ARM Holdings plc, or ARM, and Imagination Technologies Group plc.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
In evaluating NVIDIA and our business, the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves risks including, but not limited to, the risks
described below. Any one of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, which could cause our stock
price to decline. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our
business.
Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Partners
If we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets, our revenue and financial results will be adversely impacted .
NVIDIA-branded products and services are visual computing platforms that address four large markets: Gaming, Enterprise, High Performance
Computing & Cloud, and Automotive. Our GPUs and Tegra processors are designed to meet the evolving needs of these markets; however, these
markets remain extremely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product and/or service offerings,
industry standards continue to evolve and new competitors enter these markets. Our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to identify
and develop new products, services and technologies, and enhancements to our existing products, services and technologies, in a timely and cost-
effective manner and to achieve consumer and market acceptance of our products, services and technologies.
If we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets, including in significant international markets, such as China, demand for our
products, services and technologies could decrease which would cause our revenue to decline and our financial results to suffer. In addition, if we fail
to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends, our business will be harmed.
Our competitors’ products, services and technologies may be less costly, or their products, services and technologies may offer superior
functionality or different features than ours. In addition, many of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities and have
longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we
do. These competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets, quickly transition their
semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials, which could
harm our business.
If we fail to achieve design wins for our products our business will be harmed.
For our products that we do not sell directly to consumers, achieving design wins is an integral part of our future success. Our OEM, ODM, and
AIB and motherboard manufacturers' customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year, typically based on spring
and fall design cycles or in connection with trade shows. If OEMs, ODMs, and AIB and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products in
their systems, they will typically not use our products in their systems until at least the next design configuration. In order to achieve design wins, we
must:
• anticipate the features and functionality that customers and consumers will demand;
• incorporate those features and functionalities into products that meet the exacting design requirements of our customers; and
• price our products competitively.
In general, we are limited in our ability to introduce new products and enhancements to our customers' design cycles and we must maintain
compliance with evolving industry standards. Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products
developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards, our
customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies.

If our intellectual property licensing strategy is not successful, our licensing revenues may decline.
We intend to license our GPU cores and visual computing patent portfolio to device manufacturers who offer products in markets such as
mobile. The extent of the demand to license our GPU cores or other elements of our visual computing patent portfolio is unknown and may be
limited. In addition, we may not be able to renew our existing license agreements. In January 2011, we entered into a patent cross licensing
agreement under which Intel agreed to pay us an aggregate of $1.50 billion over six years. The final $200.0 million payment under this agreement is
scheduled to be received in January 2016, and recognized as revenue into the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. If we are unable to enter into new
licensing agreements or renew our existing agreements, and these agreements are not offset by other growth in income, our financial results may be
adversely affected.
If our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects, our reputation could be damaged and
we could lose market share.
Our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design,
fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. Our products are used by a variety of industries, including the automotive industry.
Failure of our products to perform to specifications, or other product defects, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to
customers, the end product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such
end product. Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs, cause us to lose market share, and
divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. In addition, an error or defect in
new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market
acceptance or loss of design wins and harm our relationships with customers. Also, we may be required to reimburse customers, including our
customers' costs to repair or replace products in the field. A product recall, particularly an automotive recall, or a significant number of product
returns could be expensive, could damage our reputation, could result in the shifting of business to our competitors and could result in litigation
against us such as product liability suits. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and
would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business.
System security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue and increase
our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation.
Security breaches, computer malware and cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years. These attacks have
occurred on our systems in the past and may occur in the future. Experienced computer programmers, hackers and employees may be able to
penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information, or that of our employees or third parties. These
attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These hackers may also develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software
programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products. For portions of our IT infrastructure, including business
management and communication software products, we rely on products and services provided by third parties. These providers may also experience
breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, such as
actions by an employee with access to our systems.
Actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary
information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our partners, our customers or third parties could expose us, our partners, our customers, third
parties or the individuals affected, to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability, damage to our brand and
reputation or other harm to our business. Our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be
successful. We may experience interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. Such disruptions could
adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these
disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.

We depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test and/or package our products, which reduces our control over
product quantity and quality, development, enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business .
We do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our GPUs and Tegra processors and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility.
Instead, we are dependent on industry-leading foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics
Co. Ltd., to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. Similarly, we do not assemble, test or package
our products, but instead rely on independent subcontractors, such as Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., BYD Auto Co., Ltd., Hon Hai
Precision Industry Co., Ltd., JSI Logistics, Ltd., King Yuan Electronics Co. and Siliconware Precision Industries Co. Ltd. We do not have long-term
commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors. As a result, we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our
ability to meet customer demands and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:
• a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices due to supply constraints;
• a failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate manufacturing or test capacity for our products;
• a failure to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality, leading-edge process technologies, including transitions to smaller
geometry process technologies, needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis;
• loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and
commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier;
• a lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality; and
• delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or
foundries prioritize our competitors orders over our orders or otherwise.
We also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new products or product
enhancements. To bring new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner, we utilize sophisticated and technologically advanced
software development tools to complete our design, simulations and verifications. In the past, we have experienced delays in the introduction of
products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and
functionalities of our products. In the future, the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater
functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. If we miss design cycles or lose design wins
due to the unavailability of such software development tools, we could lose market share and our revenues could decline.
If our products fail to achieve expected manufacturing yields, our financial results could be adversely impacted and our reputation with our
customers may be harmed.
Manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design, which is developed largely by us, and process technology, which
typically is proprietary to the foundry. Low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure. We do not know whether a
yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry. When a yield issue is identified, the product is analyzed and tested
to determine the cause. As a result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to
cooperate to resolve the problem. Because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry capacity, any decrease in manufacturing yields could
result in higher manufacturing costs and require us to allocate our available product supply among our customers. Lower than expected yields could
harm customer relationships, our reputation and our financial results.

Business disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs.
Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, tsunamis, floods,
hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic
events or climate change. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses, a decline in
revenue and increase our costs and expenses. Any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to
fully resume operations. Our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our research and development activities, are located in California, and other
critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. In addition, a
majority of our principal IT datacenters are located in California, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions
occurring in this geographical area. The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are
concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China and Korea. Our operations could be harmed if manufacturing, logistics or
other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, information
technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. The ultimate
impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being
consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster or catastrophic event, our revenue
could decline and our business may be harmed.
We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers and our revenue could decline if we lose any of these
customers.
We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers. Revenue from significant customers, those representing
10% or more of total revenue, was 11% of our total revenue from one customer in fiscal year 2015, 21% of our total revenue from two customers in
fiscal year 2014, and 13% of our total revenue from one customer in fiscal year 2013. The percentage of revenue we receive from our largest
customers has fluctuated significantly from period to period primarily due to the timing and number of design wins with each customer, as well as the
continued diversification of our customer base as we expand into new markets, and will likely continue to fluctuate in the future. Our operating
results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers, as well as the ability of these customers to
sell products that incorporate our GPUs and Tegra processors. In the future, these customers may decide not to purchase our products at all, purchase
fewer products than they did in the past, or alter their purchasing patterns in some other way, particularly because:
• substantially all of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, which permits our customers to cancel, change or delay product purchase
commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty;
• our customers may develop their own solutions;
• our customers may purchase products from our competitors; or
• our customers may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products.
The loss of any of our large customers or a significant reduction in purchases by them would likely harm our financial condition and results of
operations and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial condition.
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our customers to make required
payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers. In the future, we may have to record additional
provisions or write-offs and/or defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results and we may not be able
to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient.
Our gross margin depends on a number of factors and changes in any of these factors could adversely affect our gross margin.
Our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors, including the mix of our products sold, average selling prices, introduction of
new products, product transitions, sales discounts, pricing actions by our competitors, the cost of product components and the yield of wafers
produced by the foundries that manufacture our products. We are focused on improving our gross margin and if we are not able to control or estimate
the impact of the above factors or other factors we do not foresee, our gross margins may be negatively impacted. In addition, gross margins for our
Tegra processors are lower than our overall corporate gross margins. If Tegra processors comprise a higher percentage of our future revenue, or if we
continue to enter into new business areas with comparatively lower margins, our overall gross margins may decline.

If we fail to estimate customer demand properly our financial results could be harmed.
We manufacture our GPUs and Tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand. In order to have shorter shipment lead times and
quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, or may build inventory
anticipating demand for a customer’s product that does not materialize. In estimating demand, we make multiple assumptions any of which may
prove to be incorrect. Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include:
• changes in business and economic conditions, including downturns in our target markets and/or overall economy;
• changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit market;
• a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products;
• a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;
• our introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products ; or
• increased competition, including competitive pricing actions.
In addition, the cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which could adversely affect
our gross margins. In addition, because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter, we may not be able to
reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals. We could be required to write-
down our inventory to the lower of cost or market or write-off excess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we
incorrectly forecast product demand, any of which could harm our financial results.
Conversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to
increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers' orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase
production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner. If we fail to fulfill our customers'
orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be
damaged.
We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations which may harm our business.
We conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the United States. Our semiconductor wafers are
manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States and Other Americas. We also generate a
significant portion of our revenue from sales to customers outside the United States and Other Americas. Revenue from sales to customers outside of
the United States and Other Americas accounted for 75% of total revenue for both fiscal year 2015 and 2014 and 74% of total revenue for fiscal
year 2013. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:
• international economic and political conditions, such as political tensions between countries in which we do business;
• unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements;
• differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices;
• local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited
from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anticorruption laws and regulations;
• exporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions;
• financial risks such as longer payment cycles, difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and foreign exchange rate fluctuations; and
• increased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations, such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and pollution limits.
If sales to any of our customers outside of the United States and Other Americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors,
our revenue may be negatively impacted.

We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments and we may not be
able to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.
We have in the past and intend to continue to acquire and invest in other businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe
will help expand or enhance our existing products and business. Any of the following risks associated with past or future acquisitions or investments
could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products, and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth
or our financial results:
• difficulty in combining the technology, products, operations or workforce of the acquired business with our business;
• diversion of capital and other resources, including management's attention;
• assumption of liabilities;
• incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;
• potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with product quality, architecture and development, or legal and
financial contingencies, among other things; and
• impairment of relationships with employees, vendors and customers, or the loss of any of our key employees, vendors or customers or our
target's key employees, vendors or customers, as a result of our acquisition or investment.
Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Common Stock and Other Matters
Actions to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, such as litigation to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property
rights or to enforce our intellectual property rights, could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we fail to
take such actions or are unsuccessful in doing so.
We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing
arrangements, and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. The laws
of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This makes
the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for
existing and new innovations and technologies, but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if
approved, whether we will be able to enforce such protections.
We have in the past and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other
intellectual property rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement. An
unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages, invalidation of a patent or family of patents,
indemnification of customers, payment of lost profits, or, when it has been sought, injunctive relief.
We may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights. Such proceedings may increase our
operating expenses, which could negatively impact our operating results. Further, we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of
litigation. For example, in September 2014, we filed complaints against Qualcomm, Inc. and various Samsung entities with both the ITC and the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware for infringement of seven patents relating to graphics processing. In November 2014, various
Samsung entities filed a complaint against us and Velocity Micro for alleged infringement of Samsung’s patents. If infringement claims are made
against us or our products are found to infringe a third parties' patent or intellectual property, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license
to the third parties' patent or other intellectual property rights. However, we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us
particularly from our competitors. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is
used in one of our products, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of
our products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments, or cross license our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on
commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may
increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results.

Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of
securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.
Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors. For example, our operating
expenses represent a significant portion of total revenue and are largely independent of revenue in any particular period. In particular, our research
and development expenses reflect multi-year commitments to the development of new products and enhancements that will not result in revenue, if
any, until future periods. Therefore, investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future
performance.
Factors that could affect our results of operations in the future include:
• demand and market acceptance for our products and/or our customers’ products;
• the successful development and volume production of our next-generation products;
• our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;
• new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors;
• our introduction of new products in accordance with OEMs’ design requirements and design cycles;
• changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our customers’ products;
• the level of growth or decline of the PC industry in general;
• seasonal fluctuations associated with the PC and consumer products market;
• contraction in automotive and consumer end-market demand due to adverse regional or worldwide economic conditions;
• slower than expected growth of demand for new technologies;
• fluctuations in the availability of manufacturing capacity or manufacturing yields;
• our ability to reduce the manufacturing costs of our products;
• competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices;
• product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues;
• rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders;
• the loss of a significant customer;
• substantial disruption in the operations of our foundries or other third-party subcontractors, as a result of a natural disaster, equipment
failure, terrorism or other causes;
• supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our customers’ products, including memory
devices;
• costs associated with the repair and replacement of defective products;
• unexpected inventory write-downs or write-offs;
• legal and other costs related to defending intellectual property and other types of lawsuits;
• availability of software and technology licenses at commercially reasonable terms for the continued sale or development of new products;
• customer bad debt write-offs;
• changes in our effective tax rate as a result of changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, applicable tax
laws or interpretations of tax laws;
• any unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities;
• unexpected costs related to our ownership of real property;
• costs to comply with new government regulations, such as the SEC’s conflict mineral regulations, and regulatory enforcement actions;
• costs to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting;
• our inability to forecast changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards; and
• general macroeconomic events and factors affecting the overall semiconductor industry.
Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results. Any such failure to meet
our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price
volatility and, as a result, investors may suffer losses.
In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its
securities. We have been in the past, and may be in the future, the target of securities litigation. Such lawsuits generally result in the diversion of
management's time and attention away from business operations, which could harm our business. In addition, the costs of defense and any damages
resulting from litigation, a ruling against us, or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results.

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our
strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations .
In December 2013, we issued $1.5 billion of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018, or 1.00% Notes. Our substantial indebtedness may:
• limit our ability to use our cash flow or borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate
and other purposes;
• make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations;
• place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and
• increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.
The exercise of warrants issued to Goldman, Sachs & Co. concurrently with our 1.00% Notes would, and the conversion of our 1.00% Notes
could, dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders .
The warrants issued concurrently with our 1.00% Notes will be deemed to be automatically exercised on certain dates between March 2019 and
June 2019, unless Goldman, Sachs & Co. notifies us otherwise. Any issuance by us of additional shares to Goldman, Sachs & Co. upon exercise of
the warrants will dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders. In addition, the conversion of our 1.00% Notes will dilute the ownership
interests of our existing shareholders and could have a dilutive effect on our net income per share to the extent that the price of our common stock
exceeds the conversion price of the 1.00% Notes. Any sales in the public market by Goldman, Sachs & Co. of our common stock upon exercise of
the warrants or sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the 1.00% Notes could adversely affect prevailing market
prices of our common stock.
Delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft Corporation could delay or
prevent a change in control.
Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or
prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after
the person becomes an interested shareholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders. In addition, our certificate
of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting
stock. These provisions include the following:
• the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval;
• the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent;
• advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals;
• the ability of our Board of Directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval;
• a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;
• the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders; and
• the ability of our Board of Directors to make, amend or repeal our bylaws.
On March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain
technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares
equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock.
The Microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA. These provisions could also
discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate
actions they desire.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Our headquarters complex is located in Santa Clara, California. It includes eight leased commercial buildings totaling 887,993 square feet and
real property that we own, which consists of twelve commercial buildings on 36 acres of land. We expect to eventually build a new corporate
headquarters campus on this owned property. However, during fiscal year 2014 we leased and occupied an office building within the boundaries of
our Santa Clara campus that balanced the workspace needs for our Santa Clara staff and provided us the opportunity to delay the start of the new
campus building and refine our design to further optimize for functionality and cost. In addition, we also lease datacenter space in Santa Clara.
Outside of Santa Clara, we lease space in Austin, Texas and a number of regional facilities in other U.S. locations, which are used as research
and development centers and/or sales and administrative offices. Outside of the United States, we own a building in Hyderabad, India, which is being
used primarily as a research and development center. We also lease facilities in various international locations as research and development centers
and/or sales and administrative offices. These leased facilities are located primarily in Asia and Europe.
We believe that we currently have sufficient facilities to conduct our operations for the next twelve months. For additional information regarding
obligations under leases, see Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K

PART II
ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES
OF EQUITY SECURITIES
Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common stock began on
January 22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of March 6, 2015, we had approximately 349 registered
shareholders, not including those shares held in street or nominee name. The following table sets forth for the periods indicated the high and low
sales price for our common stock as quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market:
High Low
Fiscal year ending January 31, 2016
First Quarter (through March 6, 2015) $ 22.90 $ 18.94
Fiscal year ended January 25, 2015
Fourth Quarter $ 21.25 $ 18.27
Third Quarter $ 20.15 $ 16.77
Second Quarter $ 19.73 $ 17.71
First Quarter $ 19.46 $ 15.32
Fiscal year ended January 26, 2014
Fourth Quarter $ 16.44 $ 14.52
Third Quarter $ 16.10 $ 13.11
Second Quarter $ 15.48 $ 13.37
First Quarter $ 13.50 $ 12.04
Dividend Policy
On November 8, 2012, we announced the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend program. The initial quarterly dividend was $0.075 per share, or
$0.30 per share on an annual basis, which was subsequently increased on November 7, 2013 by 13% to a quarterly dividend of $0.085 per share, or
$0.34 per share on an annual basis. In fiscal years 2015 and 2014, we paid $186.5 million and $181.3 million , respectively, in cash dividends to our
common shareholders.
Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to continued capital availability and our
Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our
shareholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements of NVIDIA applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends. In fiscal
year 2015, based upon our earnings and profits, 50% of our dividend payments were considered qualified dividends and 50% of our dividend
payments were considered to be a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is possible that a portion of our dividend payments in
fiscal year 2016 may be considered a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock. Most
recently, in November 2013, the Board extended the previously authorized repurchase program through January 2016 and authorized an additional
$1.00 billion for an aggregate of $3.70 billion under the repurchase program. Through January 25, 2015, we have repurchased an aggregate of 205.6
million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $3,265.2 million. As of January 25, 2015, we are authorized, subject to certain
specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $434.8 million through January 2016. In November 2014, we announced our intention
to return approximately $600.0 million to shareholders in fiscal year 2016 in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends.
21
Table of Contents
The repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase
programs, and may be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
or the Exchange Act, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to
acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion. As part of our share repurchase
program, we have entered into, and we may continue to enter into, structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions. These
agreements generally require that we make an up-front payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock
upon execution of the agreement, and a potential incremental number of shares of our common stock, within a pre-determined range, at the end of the
term of the agreement.
The following table presents details of our share repurchase transactions during the three months ended January 25, 2015 (in millions, except per
share amounts):

In December 2014, we repurchased in the open market 0.2 million shares for $3.6 million at an average price of $19.86 per share.
In addition to our share repurchase program, we withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding
obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit, or RSU, and performance stock unit, or PSU, awards under our equity incentive program.
During fiscal year 2015, we withheld approximately 2.3 million shares at a total cost of $43.7 million through net share settlements. Please refer to

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with “Item 1A. Risk
Factors”, “Item 6. Selected Financial Data”, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements
and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock.
Overview
Our Company and Our Businesses
NVIDIA is dedicated to advancing visual computing, enabling individuals to interact with digital ideas, data and entertainment with an ease and
efficiency unmatched by any other communication medium.
Our business model has three elements: creating NVIDIA-branded products and services, offering our processors to original equipment
manufacturers, or OEMs, and licensing our intellectual property. NVIDIA-branded products and services are visual computing platforms that address
four large markets: Gaming, Enterprise, High Performance Computing & Cloud, and Automotive.
Our two business segments - GPU and Tegra Processor - are based on a single underlying graphics architecture. In addition to the two reporting
segments, the “All Other” category primarily includes licensing revenue from our patent cross licensing agreement with Intel, which we expect to
recognize through March 2017.
GPUs, the engines of visual computing, are among the world's most complex processors. Our GPU product brands aimed at specialized markets
include GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla for researchers, deep learning and big-data analysts; and GRID for cloud-based visual
computing users.
We also integrate our GPUs into tiny mobile chips called system-on-a-chip (SOC) processors, which power tablets, and automotive infotainment
and safety systems. Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, incorporating GPUs and multi-core CPUs with audio, video
and input/output capabilities. They can also be integrated with baseband processors to add voice and data communication. Tegra conserves power
while delivering state-of-the-art graphics and multimedia processing.
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.
Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges
GPU Business
During fiscal year 2015, we announced and shipped GeForce GPUs based on our new Maxwell architecture and we surpassed fifty million
installations of our GeForce Experience client, which provides game-ready drivers, optimized play settings, and streaming and sharing of gameplay.
We also disclosed the first details of our Pascal GPU architecture, which will succeed Maxwell. Pascal is expected to feature 3D memory and
NVLink interconnect technology.
Quadro professional graphics continue to maintain market leadership. We refreshed our Quadro product lineup during fiscal year 2015 and also
extended our product lineup to include Maxwell-based GPUs.
We extended our reach in accelerated datacenter computing, with the world’s fifteen most highly-efficient supercomputers all utilizing our Tesla
GPUs. We continued to expand our reach in the big data analytics market, with IBM announcing future support for GPU acceleration in its IBM DB2
with BLU acceleration. We launched our Tesla K80 dual-GPU accelerator, which is designed to power a wide range of machine learning, data-
analytics and high performance computing applications. In addition, we announced that our Tesla GPUs will power the U.S. Department of Energy’s
next-generation supercomputers in conjunction with our NVIDIA NVLink high-speed interconnect technology. These systems are to be deployed at
Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories and will serve scientists to accelerate their research.
26
Table of Contents
We announced that NVIDIA GRID technology will be available on the VMware Horizon DaaS Platform to deliver 3D graphics on virtualized
desktops and applications delivered through the cloud, partnered with VMware on a customer access program for NVIDIA GRID with companies
like Airbus, CH2M Hill, MetroHealth and Halliburton, and announced that the new version of VMware’s virtualization suite, VMware Horizon 6,
includes the capability to deliver scalable, virtualized 3D graphics enabled by NVIDIA GRID vGPU. NVIDIA GRID graphics virtualization
continued to gain momentum as more companies come forward to experience cloud-based GPU-accelerated virtual desktops through our “Try
GRID” online demonstration.
Tegra Processor Business
During fiscal year 2015, we expanded our SHIELD family of gaming devices, adding the SHIELD tablet and SHIELD wireless controller to the
product family that also includes the SHIELD portable. We also launched our GRID On-Demand Streaming Service, providing it free for SHIELD
users through June 30, 2015.
We announced the NVIDIA Tegra X1 mobile processor, a 256-core Maxwell architecture-based mobile super chip with over one teraflops of
computing power. Our Tegra K1 processor was featured in Google’s Nexus 9 and Project Tango tablets, in NVIDIA's SHIELD tablet and in
Chromebooks made by Acer and HP, and was one of the first processors to support Android TV. Tegra K1 was also included in our launch of Jetson
TK1, a development platform aimed at automotive, robotics, defense and embedded applications.
In automotive, we launched NVIDIA DRIVE automotive computers - a computing platform for advanced driver assistance systems and digital
cockpits that could enable auto-piloted cars and run state of the art infotainment systems. NVIDIA DRIVE is powered by the Tegra X1. We also
announced that many automobile manufacturers were shipping various new models with infotainment systems powered by NVIDIA, including the
BMW i8 and i3, the Volkswagen Golf and Passat, and the Honda Civic, Civic Tourer and CR-V.
Capital Return to Shareholders
During fiscal year 2015, we repurchased 44.4 million shares of our common stock for $813.6 million and paid $186.5 million in cash dividends.
As a result, we returned $1.00 billion to shareholders during fiscal year 2015 in the form of share repurchases and dividend payments.
On November 6, 2014 we announced our intention to return approximately $600.0 million to our shareholders in fiscal year 2016 through a
combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. On February 11, 2015, we declared that we would pay our next quarterly cash dividend of
$0.085 per share on March 19, 2015, to all shareholders of record on February 26, 2015.
Please refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further
discussion.
Litigation
In September 2014, we filed lawsuits against Qualcomm, Inc. and various Samsung entities in the United States International Trade
Commission, or ITC, and the United States District Court for the District of Delaware for using our GPU patents without a license. On November 10,
2014, Samsung filed a complaint against NVIDIA and Velocity Micro, Inc., in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.
The complaint alleges that NVIDIA infringed six patents and falsely advertised that the Tegra K1 processor is the world’s fastest mobile processor.
On December 19, 2014, Samsung filed an amended, longer complaint but asserting the same claims against NVIDIA.
Please refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue,
expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition,
inventories, income taxes, goodwill, cash equivalents and marketable securities, stock-based compensation, and litigation, investigation and
settlement costs and other contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit
Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Revenue Recognition
Product Revenue
We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed
or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
For sales to certain distributors with rights of return for which the level of returns cannot be reasonably estimated, our policy is to defer
recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product and, in some cases, when customer return rights lapse.
Our customer programs primarily involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target
markets. We account for rebates as a reduction of revenue and accrue for 100% of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor. While we
have a long history of rebate arrangements with OEMs, we believe we are unable to apply our historical experience to reliably estimate the amount of
rebates that will eventually be claimed by individual OEMs. In such cases, the OEMs may not be our direct customers and therefore the quantity and
mix of demand they place on their CEMs/ODMs may shift as we introduce new generations and iterations of products and as we experience changes
in new competitor offerings. In addition, we typically find that approximately 95% of the rebates we accrue each year are eventually claimed, which
is substantially close to 100%, and that this percentage varies by program and by customer. We recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of
the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate. Rebates typically expire six months from the date of the
original sale, unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate. Unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue, the amount of
which typically represents approximately 0.5% of total revenue.
Our customer programs also include marketing development funds, or MDFs. MDFs represent monies paid to retailers, system builders, OEMs,
distributors, add-in card partners and other channel partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are
designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. Depending on market conditions, we may take actions to
increase amounts offered under customer programs, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered.
We account for MDFs as a reduction of revenue and apply a breakage factor to certain types of MDF program accruals for which we believe we can
make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be unclaimed.
We also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized,
based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine
that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.
28
Table of Contents
License and Development Revenue
For license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components, we generally recognize the related
revenue over the period that services are performed. For most license and service arrangements, we determine progress to completion based on actual
direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project. We periodically evaluate
the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate. Revenue recognized in any period is
dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress. Significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total
direct labor hours. Any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any
period.
For license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of
the license agreement, we record revenue over the life of the license term, with consideration received in advance of the performance period
classified as deferred revenue.
Please refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for
additional information.
Inventories
Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. We charge
cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or estimated market value or to completely write off obsolete
or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future
product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in consumer confidence
caused by changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of rapidly
changing technology and customer requirements, failure to estimate customer demand properly for older products as newer products are introduced,
or unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition. In addition, cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our
holding excess inventory. Also, because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter, we may not be able to
reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals.
Charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions totaled $59.4 million, $50.1 million and $89.9 million for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013,
unfavorably impacting our gross margin by 1.3%, 1.2% and 2.1%, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down
totaled $32.4 million, $43.4 million and $53.7 million for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, favorably impacting our gross margin by 0.7%, 1.1% and
1.3%, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was
an unfavorable impact of 0.6%, 0.1% and 0.8% in fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
During fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, the charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions were primarily related to the write-off of
excess quantities of GPU and Tegra Processor products whose inventory levels were higher than our updated forecasts of future demand for those
products. As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand. In
doing so, we must account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product
offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our
products.
Please refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.
Income Taxes
We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal
year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects
attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any
tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.
29
Table of Contents
United States income tax has not been provided on a portion of earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are
considered to be indefinitely reinvested.
Our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with
uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on
added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where
we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax
contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts
is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional
income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.
As of January 25, 2015, we had a valuation allowance of $261.0 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management
determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes
acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would
recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period.
Goodwill
Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment
exist, using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which
the goodwill resides to its carrying value. We have identified two reporting units, GPU and Tegra Processor, for the purposes of completing our
goodwill analysis. Goodwill assigned to these reporting units as of January 25, 2015 was $209.7 million and $408.5 million , respectively.
Determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant
estimates and assumptions. We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units. We base our
fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we elected to use the quantitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment for each reporting
unit. In applying the fair value based test of each reporting unit, the results from the income approach and the market approach were equally
weighted. These valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth
rates, terminal or residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make
certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.
When performing an income approach valuation, we incorporate the use of projected financial information and a discount rate that are developed
using market participant based assumptions to our discounted cash flow model. Our estimates of discounted cash flow were based upon, among other
things, certain assumptions about our expected future operating performance, such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, risk-adjusted discount
rates, and future economic and market conditions. Our estimates may differ from actual cash flow due to, among other things, economic conditions,
changes to our business model or changes in operating performance. Additionally, certain estimates of discounted cash flow involve businesses with
limited financial history and developing revenue models, which increases the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance. The
long-term financial forecasts that we utilize represent the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are
reasonable. Significant differences between our estimates and actual cash flow could materially affect our future financial results, which could impact
our future estimates of the fair value of our reporting units.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill. The fair value of our GPU reporting
unit significantly exceeded its carrying value and the fair value of our Tegra Processor reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 21%. As such,
even if we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit, it still would not have resulted in the fair value of our
reporting units being less than their carrying values. As an overall test of the reasonableness of estimated fair values of our reporting units, we
reconciled the combined fair value estimates of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of the valuation date. The reconciliation confirmed
that the fair values were relatively representative of the market views when applying a reasonable control premium to the market capitalization.
However, any significant reductions in the actual amount of future cash flows realized by our reporting units, reductions in the value of market
comparables, or reductions in our market capitalization could impact future estimates of the fair values of our reporting units. Such events could
ultimately result in a charge to our earnings in future periods due to the potential for a write-down of the goodwill associated with our reporting units.

Table of Contents
In particular, the fair value of our Tegra reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 21%. The fair value of this reporting unit
was assessed using a combination of income and market approaches. The underlying assumptions we used in assessing the fair value of the Tegra
reporting unit include, but are not limited to, assumptions around future revenue growth rates, gross margins, operating expense investment levels,
overall market growth rates, our market share of the overall market, and the appropriate discount rates to apply to future cash flows. If the actual
future results of the Tegra reporting unit do not achieve the levels we estimated in assessing its fair value, the fair value of the Tegra reporting unit
could decline. A future decline in the fair value of the Tegra reporting unit could result a charge to our earnings as a result of a write-down of the
value of the goodwill associated with that reporting unit.
Our next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, or earlier if
indicators of potential impairment exist. Such indicators include, but are not limited to, challenging economic conditions, such as a decline in our
operating results, an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment, a substantial decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in
market conditions. Such conditions could have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the fair value of
our reporting units, which could result in a decrease in fair value and require us to record goodwill impairment charges.
Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
Cash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at
the time of acquisition. Marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than three months when
purchased.
We measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value. The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined
using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets. Our Level 1 assets consist of our money
market funds. We classify securities within Level 1 assets when the fair value is obtained from real time quotes for transactions in active exchange
markets involving identical assets. Our available-for-sale securities are classified as having Level 2 inputs. Our Level 2 assets are valued utilizing a
market approach where the market prices of similar assets are provided by a variety of independent industry standard data providers to our
investment custodian. Most of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are valued based on Level 2 inputs. We did not have any investments
classified as Level 3 as of January 25, 2015 .
All of our available-for-sale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value
is significantly below cost basis and judged to be other-than-temporary, or have other indicators of impairments.
If the fair value of an available-for-sale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis, an other-than-temporary impairment is triggered in
circumstances where (1) we intend to sell the instrument, (2) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery
of its amortized cost basis, or (3) a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument. In these
situations, we recognize an other-than-temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments’ amortized cost
basis and its fair value. For available-for-sale debt instruments that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit
loss, if we do not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining
amortized cost basis (amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss), we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit
related and the amount due to all other factors. The credit loss component is recognized in earnings.
We performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of January 25, 2015. We concluded that our investments were appropriately
valued and that no other than temporary impairment charges were necessary on our portfolio of available-for-sale investments as of January 25, 2015.
Stock-based Compensation
Our stock-based compensation expense is associated with stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units, or PSUs, and
our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP.
During fiscal year 2015, we shifted away from granting stock options and toward granting RSUs and PSUs to reflect changing market trends for
equity incentives at our peer companies. The number of PSUs that will ultimately vest is contingent on the Company’s level of achievement
compared with the corporate financial performance target established by our Compensation Committee in the beginning of each fiscal year. The
number of shares of our stock to be received at vesting ranges from 0% to 200% of the target amount.
31
Table of Contents
We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of RSUs
and PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period,
while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under
our ESPP using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based
compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model.
Our RSU and PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair value of RSUs and PSUs is discounted by the
dividend yield. Additionally, we estimate forfeitures annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent
periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. If factors change, the compensation expense that we record under these accounting standards
may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period.
Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs
From time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. We are aggressively defending our current
litigation matters. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations, and we cannot be certain that these actions
or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. If that occurs, our
business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If information becomes available that causes us to
determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated
with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be
materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.

Revenue was $4.68 billion , $4.13 billion and $4.28 billion for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. A discussion of our revenue
results for each of our reporting segments and the All Other category is as follows:
GPU Business. GPU business revenue increased by 11% in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. This increase was due primarily to
higher revenue from GeForce GTX GPUs and associated memory for gaming, reflecting a combination of continued strength in PC gaming and
increased sales of our Maxwell-based GPU products. Revenue from Tesla for accelerated datacenter computing increased due to large project wins
with cloud service providers and revenue from our NVIDIA GRID virtualization products also increased as this platform gained momentum.
Revenue from GPU products for mainstream PC OEMs declined compared to last year.
GPU business revenue increased by 7% in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013. This increase was largely attributable to strength in our
high-end GeForce GTX GPUs driven by gaming market segment demand. The GPU business also benefited from higher sales of Tesla accelerated
datacenter computing and Quadro enterprise products in fiscal year 2014. Offsetting these growth areas were declines in the overall market for
mainstream desktop PCs and notebooks, which contributed to lower unit volumes of our mainstream GeForce GPUs.
Tegra Processor Business. Tegra Processor business revenue increased by 45% in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 . This increase
was driven by higher sales of Tegra products serving automotive infotainment systems, smartphones and tablet devices, and the onset of SHIELD
tablet sales in fiscal year 2015.
Tegra Processor business revenue decreased by 48% in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013. This decrease was primarily due to lower
sales of our previous generation Tegra 3-based products for smartphones and tablet devices. Additionally, sales of our embedded products for
entertainment devices and revenue from license fees related to game consoles also decreased during fiscal year 2014. These decreases were partially
offset by increased sales of Tegra 4-based products for smartphones and tablet devices, as well as for automotive infotainment systems.
All Other. License revenue from the patent cross licensing arrangement we entered into with Intel in January 2011 was flat at $264.0 million for
fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013.
Concentration of Revenue
Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and Other Americas accounted for 75% of total revenue for both fiscal years 2015
and 2014, and 74% of total revenue for fiscal year 2013. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to
which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location.
Revenue from significant customers, those representing 10% or more of total revenue for the respective dates, is summarized as follows:

Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors
purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs,
including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions and shipping costs. Cost of
revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with
manufacturing.
Gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue. Our gross margin can vary in any period depending on the mix of types of products
sold. Our gross margin is significantly impacted by the mix of products we sell, which is often difficult to estimate with accuracy. Therefore, if we
experience product transition challenges, if we achieve significant revenue growth in our lower margin product lines, or if we are unable to earn as
much revenue as we expect from higher margin product lines, our gross margin may be negatively impacted.
Our overall gross margin was 55.5% , 54.9% and 52.0% for fiscal years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The increase over these fiscal years
was driven primarily by a richer product mix in our GPU business, partially offset by lower Tegra business margins.
Charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions totaled $59.4 million, $50.1 million and $89.9 million for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013,
unfavorably impacting our gross margin by 1.3%, 1.2% and 2.1%, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down
totaled $32.4 million, $43.4 million and $53.7 million for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, favorably impacting our gross margin by 0.7%, 1.1% and
1.3%, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was
an unfavorable impact of 0.6%, 0.1% and 0.8% in fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reporting segments is as follows:
GPU Business . The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2015 when compared to fiscal year 2014 due to richer
product mix resulting from strong sales of high-end GeForce GTX GPU products based on our Maxwell architecture and the volume increase in our
Tesla accelerated computing products. The increase in fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to a combination of a
richer product mix of our high-end GeForce GTX GPU, Tesla high performance computing, and Quadro professional workstation products. Lower
inventory provisions for excess inventory in fiscal year 2014 also contributed to the increase.
Tegra Processor Business. The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business decreased during fiscal year 2015 when compared to fiscal year
2014, and during fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013. These decreases were driven primarily by a combination of an overall decline
in margins of our Tegra products and a less rich mix between tablet products, which have had higher gross margins, and smartphone and automotive
module products, which have had comparably lower gross margins.

Research and Development
Research and development expenses remained relatively flat during fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. Compensation and benefits
increased by $56.5 million resulting from employee additions, employee compensation increases and related costs, including stock-based
compensation expense. Offsetting this increase was a $38.9 million decrease in engineering development expenses.
Research and development expenses increased by 16% in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013. Compensation and benefits increased by
$101.9 million resulting from employee additions, employee compensation increases and related costs. The growth in engineering employees also
drove an increase in facilities and IT support expense of $34.6 million, purchases of computer and software supplies of $14.1 million and
depreciation and amortization of $11.0 million. In addition, engineering development expenses increased by $23.2 million, primarily related to the
ramp up of Tegra products.
Sales, General and Administrative
Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 10% in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. Compensation and benefits
increased by $53.7 million resulting from employee additions, employee compensation increases and related costs, including stock-based
compensation expense. Facilities costs increased by $10.3 million as we expanded our offices internationally and leased an office building within the
boundaries of our main Santa Clara campus. Offsetting these increases were a decrease in outside professional fees of $8.8 million as well as more
favorable international taxes and government subsidies.
Sales, general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat during fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013. Compensation and
benefits increased by $37.9 million resulting from employee additions, employee compensation increases and related costs. Offsetting this increase
were the absence of both a $20.1 million charge for a charitable contribution and a charge of $3.1 million for a class action settlement that we
recorded in fiscal year 2013.

Table of Contents
Interest Income and Interest Expense
Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon
interest and debt discount amortization related to the convertible notes issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014.
Interest income was $28.1 million , $17.1 million and $19.9 million in fiscal years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The increase in fiscal
year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to higher average cash balances as we invested the proceeds from the convertible notes we
issued in December 2013 in interest bearing securities. The decrease in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to the result
of lower average cash balances as we liquidated a portion of our investment portfolio to fund an accelerated share repurchase transaction during the
second quarter of fiscal year 2014.
Interest expense was $46.1 million , $10.4 million and $3.3 million in fiscal years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The increases in fiscal
years 2015 and 2014 compared to fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively, were primarily due to coupon interest and debt discount amortization
related to the convertible notes we issued in December 2013.
Other Income and Expense
Other income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses from the sale of marketable securities, sales or impairments of
investments in non-affiliated companies, and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates.
Net other income (expense) was $ 13.9 million , $ 7.4 million and $ (2.8) million in fiscal years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The
increase for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to a gain from the sale of a non-affiliated investment, partially offset by
the recognition of an impairment loss of a non-affiliated investment during the second quarter of fiscal year 2015 and losses from foreign currency
remeasurement. The increase in other income for fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to an increase in gains from
foreign currency remeasurements and a gain from the sale of a non-affiliated investment.
Income Taxes
We recognized income tax expense of $ 124.2 million , $ 70.3 million and $ 99.5 million during fiscal years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
Income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes, or our annual effective tax rate, was 16.5% , 13.8% , and 15.0% in fiscal years 2015 ,
2014 and 2013 , respectively. The difference in the effective tax rates amongst the three years was primarily due to an increase in the amount of
earnings subject to United States tax in fiscal year 2015 and a higher percentage of research tax credit benefit in fiscal year 2014.
Our effective tax rate on income before tax for the fiscal years was lower than the United States federal statutory rate of 35% due to income
earned in jurisdictions, including British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, where the tax rate is lower, favorable
recognition of the U.S. federal research tax credit and release of tax reserves as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitations in certain non-U.S.
jurisdictions for which we had not previously recognized related tax benefits.

As of January 25, 2015 , we had $4.62 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, a decrease of $48.5 million from the end of
fiscal year 2014 . Our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed on our behalf by several financial institutions which are
required to follow our investment policy, which requires the purchase of high grade investment securities, the diversification of asset types and
includes certain limits on our portfolio duration.
Cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to higher net income from
revenue growth and contained operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in inventories resulting from the introduction of newly launched
Maxwell-based GPUs and certain Tegra SOCs and SHIELD devices, and an increase in accounts receivable. Cash provided by operating activities
increased slightly in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 primarily due to a decrease in operating assets offset by a decrease in net
income. The decrease in operating assets was driven mainly by a combination of a decrease in accounts receivable, resulting from strong collections
and linear monthly shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, and a decrease in inventories.
Cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2015 decreased from fiscal year 2014 primarily due to lower purchases of property and
equipment and intangible assets. Cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2014 increased from fiscal year 2013 driven primarily by capital
expenditures in fiscal year 2014 for new technology licenses and leasehold improvements at our facilities in various locations.
Cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2015 resulted primarily from our repurchase of $ 813.6 million of shares of our common stock and
our cash dividend payments totaling $186.5 million . These uses of cash were offset by cash proceeds of $153.5 million from common stock issued
under our employee stock plans. Cash provided by financing activities increased in fiscal year 2014 due primarily to the net proceeds of $1.48 billion
we received from the convertible note offering that was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, as well as cash proceeds of $70.2
million from common stock issued under our employee stock plans. Concurrent with the convertible note offering, we used net proceeds of $108.0
million to fund the related note hedge and warrant transactions. During fiscal year 2014, we also used $887.3 million to repurchase shares of our
common stock and paid $181.3 million of cash dividends to shareholders.

Liquidity
Our primary source of liquidity is cash generated by our operations. Our investment portfolio consists principally of cash and cash equivalents,
debt securities of corporations and United States government and its agencies, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities issued by
government-sponsored enterprises, money market funds and foreign government bonds. These investments are denominated in United States dollars.
As of January 25, 2015 , we did not have any investments in auction-rate preferred securities.
Please refer to Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for
additional information.
As of January 25, 2015 and January 26, 2014 , we had $ 4.62 billion and $ 4.67 billion , respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities. Our investment policy requires the purchase of high grade investment securities and the diversification of asset types and includes certain
limits on our portfolio duration, as specified in our investment policy guidelines. These guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one
issue, issuer or type of instrument. As of January 25, 2015 , we were in compliance with our investment policy. As of January 25, 2015 , our
investments in U.S. government agencies and U.S. government sponsored enterprises represented 35% of our total investment portfolio, while the
financial sector accounted for 30% of our total investment portfolio. All of our investments are with A/A3 or better rated securities.
We performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of January 25, 2015 . Based on our quarterly impairment review, we
concluded that our investments were appropriately valued and did not record any impairment during fiscal year 2015 .
Net realized gains were $ 0.1 million , $ 2.4 million and $ 0.5 million for fiscal years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. As of January 25,
2015 , we had a net unrealized gain of $ 8.4 million , which was comprised of gross unrealized gains of $ 11.0 million , offset by $ 2.6 million of
gross unrealized losses. As of January 26, 2014 , we had a net unrealized gain of $ 4.8 million , which was comprised of gross unrealized gains of
$7.2 million , offset by $ 2.4 million of gross unrealized losses.
Our accounts receivable are highly concentrated. Two customers accounted for 30% of our accounts receivable balance at January 25, 2015 .
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This
allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure.
Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, including substantial amounts held outside of the United States. As of
January 25, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.72 billion held within the United States and $2.90 billion held
outside of the United States. Most of the amounts held outside the United States may be repatriated to the United States but, under current law,
would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. Further, repatriation of some foreign balances may be restricted by
local laws. As of January 25, 2015, we have not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes on approximately $2.27 billion of undistributed
earnings of non-United States subsidiaries, as such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Although we have no
current need to do so, if we repatriate foreign earnings for cash requirements in the United States, we would incur U.S. federal and state income tax,
less applicable foreign tax credits, and reduced by the current amount of our U.S. federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
Further, in addition to the $1.72 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held within the United States and available to fund our
U.S. operations and any other U.S. cash needs, we have access to external sources of financing if cash is needed in the United States other than by
repatriation of foreign earnings where U.S. income tax may otherwise be due. Accordingly, we do not reasonably expect any material effect on our
business, as a whole, or to our financial flexibility with respect to our current cash balances held outside of the United States.
Dividend payments and any share repurchases must be made from cash held in the United States. For fiscal year 2015, we made total cash
dividend payments of $186.5 million and repurchased $813.6 million of our common stock, utilizing a significant amount of our U.S. cash balance
previously taxed as of January 25, 2015 .

Convertible Notes
On December 2, 2013, we issued $1.50 billion of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes, or the Notes, due in 2018 and concurrently entered into
separate note hedge and warrant transactions and used $14.3 million to repurchase shares of our common stock from purchasers of the Notes in
privately negotiated transactions. The Notes will mature on December 1, 2018 unless earlier repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms
prior to such date. As of January 25, 2015, none of the conditions allowing holders of the Notes to convert had been met. Please refer to Note 11 of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.
Capital Return to Shareholders
Our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase up to $3.70 billion of our common stock through January 2016. As of January 25, 2015 ,
we had repurchased $3,265.2 million of that amount, leaving up to $434.8 million available under this authorization through January 2016. During
fiscal year 2015, we repurchased 44.4 million shares of our common stock for $813.6 million and paid $186.5 million in cash dividends - equivalent
to $0.085 per share on a quarterly basis, or $0.34 per share on an annual basis - to our common shareholders. As a result, we returned $1.0 billion to
shareholders during fiscal year 2015 in the form of share repurchases and dividend payments.
On November 6, 2014 we announced our intention to return approximately $600.0 million to our shareholders in fiscal year 2016 through a
combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. On February 11, 2015, we declared that we would pay our next quarterly cash dividend of
$0.085 per share on March 19, 2015, to all shareholders of record on February 26, 2015.
Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to continued capital availability and our
Board's continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders
and are in compliance with all laws and agreements of NVIDIA applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends. Please refer to Note 14
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.
Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements
We believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating, acquisition, share
repurchase, cash dividend and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, there is no assurance that we will not need to raise
additional equity or debt financing within this time frame. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive
to our then-current shareholders. We also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated. If we are unable to obtain
sufficient capital, we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures, which could harm our
business. Factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and, as a result, our need to seek additional borrowings or capital
include:
• decreased demand and market acceptance for our products and/or our customers’ products;
• inability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our next-generation products;
• competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices; and
• new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors.
We expect to spend approximately $150.0 million to $200.0 million for capital expenditures during fiscal year 2016, primarily for facilities,
emulation equipment, computers and engineering workstations.

(2) Includes facilities leases as well as non-cancelable obligations under certain software licensing arrangements in the operating lease category.
(3) Represents unrecognized tax benefits of $121.0 million which consists of $106.6 million plus the related interest and penalties of $14.4
million recorded in non-current income tax payable as of January 25, 2015. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any
potential tax liability or interest/penalty payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the
timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions.
(4) Represents the remaining portion of a retention program totaling approximately $61.5 million that we initiated in fiscal year 2012 in
connection with our acquisition of Icera. As of January 25, 2015 , we have made payments of $58.0 million in connection with this program.
The remaining payments will be paid out within the next year.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
During fiscal years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K 303(a)(4)(ii).
Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Investment and Interest Rate Risk
As of January 25, 2015 and January 26, 2014 , we had $4.62 billion and $4.67 billion , respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities. We invest in a variety of financial instruments, consisting principally of cash and cash equivalents, debt securities of corporations and
United States government and its agencies, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises, money
market funds and foreign government bonds. As of January 25, 2015 , we did not have any investments in auction-rate preferred securities. All of our
investments are denominated in United States dollars.
As of January 25, 2015 , we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments. According to our analysis,
parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5% would result in changes in fair values for these investments of $26 million - $28 million .
Please refer to Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional
information.
Other income and expense could also vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of
financial instruments; impairment charges related to debt securities as well as equity and other investments; interest rates; and cash, cash equivalent
and marketable securities balances. Volatility in the financial markets and economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in
the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them. As of January 25, 2015 , our
investments in government agencies and government sponsored enterprises represented 35% of our total investment portfolio, while the financial
sector accounted for 30% of our total investment portfolio. Substantially all of our investments are with A/A3 or better rated securities. If the fair
value of our investments in these sectors was to decline by 2% - 5%, the fair values of these investments could decline by approximately $57 million
- $144 million .
On December 2, 2013, we issued $1.50 billion of 1.00 % Convertible Senior Notes due 2018, or the Notes. The Notes are unsecured,
unsubordinated obligations of the Company, which pay interest in cash semi-annually at a rate of 1.00% per annum. We carry the Notes at face value
less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheets. Since the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk
associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of the Notes changes primarily when the market price of our stock fluctuates.
Exchange Rate Risk
We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are
included in “Other expense, net” in our Consolidated Financial Statements and to date have not been significant. The impact of foreign currency
transaction gain (loss) included in determining net income for fiscal years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $0.5 million , $4.7 million and $(1.5) million,
respectively.
Sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to
exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive,
which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies
could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have international operations and incur
expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker
dollar.
We may enter into certain transactions such as forward contracts which are designed to reduce the future potential impact resulting from changes
in foreign currency exchange rates. There were no forward exchange contracts outstanding at January 25, 2015 .

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on their evaluation as of January 25, 2015 , our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the
Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
Exchange Ac t Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 25, 2015 based
on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework , our management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 25, 2015 .
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 25, 2015 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures
or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that
there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been
detected.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of NVIDIA Corporation:
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries at January 25, 2015 and January 26, 2014 , and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 25, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under item 15(a)
(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 25,
2015 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, and financial statement schedule, for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on
these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinions.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Our Company
NVIDIA is dedicated to advancing visual computing. We enable individuals to interact with digital ideas, data and entertainment with an ease
and efficiency unmatched by any other communication medium.
Our two reporting segments - GPU and Tegra Processor - are based on a single underlying graphics architecture.
Our GPU product brands aimed at specialized markets include GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla for researchers, deep learning
and big-data analysts; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users.
We also integrate our GPUs into tiny mobile chips called system-on-a-chip (SOC) processors, which power tablets, and automotive infotainment
and safety systems. Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, incorporating GPUs and multi-core CPUs with audio, video
and input/output capabilities. They can also be integrated with baseband processors to add voice and data communication. Tegra conserves power
while delivering state-of-the-art graphics and multimedia processing.
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.
All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries, except where it is made clear
that the term means only the parent company.
Fiscal Year
We operate on a 52- or a 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were 52-week years.
Reclassifications
Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.
Principles of Consolidation
Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, inventories, income
taxes, goodwill, cash equivalents and marketable securities, stock-based compensation, and litigation, investigation and settlement costs and other
contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
Revenue Recognition
Product Revenue
We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed
or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. For most sales, we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we
use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement. We consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed
to the customer. At the point of sale, we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured. If
we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured, we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably
assured, which is generally upon receipt of payment.
For sales to certain distributors with rights of return for which the level of returns cannot be reasonably estimated, our policy is to defer
recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product and, in some cases, when customer return rights lapse.
Our customer programs primarily involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target
markets. We account for rebates as a reduction of revenue and recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the
related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate. Unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue.
Our customer programs also include marketing development funds, or MDFs. MDFs represent monies paid to retailers, system builders, original
equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, distributors, add-in card partners and other channel partners that are earmarked for market segment development
and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for MDFs as a
reduction of revenue and apply a breakage factor to certain types of MDF programs.
We also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized,
based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine
that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.
License and Development Revenue
For license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components, we generally recognize the related
revenue over the period that services are performed. For most license and service arrangements, we determine progress to completion based on actual
direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project. A provision for estimated
losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. Costs incurred in advance of revenue
recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts. If the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized, the excess
amount is recorded as deferred revenue.
For license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of
the license agreement, we record revenue over the life of the license term, with consideration received in advance of the performance period
classified as deferred revenue.
Royalty revenue is recognized related to the distribution or sale of products that use our technologies under license agreements with third
parties. We recognize royalty revenue upon receipt of a confirmation of earned royalties and when collectability is reasonably assured from the
applicable licensee.
Research and Development Expense
Research and development expense includes the conceptual formulation, design, and testing of product alternatives, construction of prototypes,
and operation of pilot plants Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred.

Advertising Expenses
We expense advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred. Advertising expenses for fiscal years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were $ 14.6
million , $13.1 million and $9.2 million , respectively.
Rent Expense
We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period and accrue for rent expense incurred, but not paid.
Product Warranties
We generally offer limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any
manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the
point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also
accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.
Stock-based Compensation
We estimate the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a binomial model and recognize the expense using a straight-line
attribution method over the requisite employee service period. We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a
dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units, or PSUs. The compensation
expense for the RSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense
for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase
plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based
compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model.
Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs
From time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. We are aggressively defending our current
litigation matters. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or
other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. If that occurs, our business,
financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If information becomes available that causes us to determine
that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such
events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially
different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.
Foreign Currency Remeasurement
We use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are
remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment, and
equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period,
except for those expenses related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses
from foreign currency remeasurement are included in “Other income (expense), net” in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not
been significant.
The impact of gain or loss from foreign currency remeasurement included in determining other income (expense), net for fiscal years 2015 ,
2014 and 2013 was $ 0.5 million , $ 4.7 million and $ (1.5) million , respectively.

Income Taxes
We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal
year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects
attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any
tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.
United States income tax has not been provided on a portion of earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are
considered to be indefinitely reinvested.
Our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with
uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on
added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where
we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax
contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts
is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional
income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.
As of January 25, 2015, we had a valuation allowance of $261.0 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management
determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes
acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would
recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period.
Our deferred tax assets do not include the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation that are a component of our federal and state
net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards in the amount of $411.9 million as of January 25, 2015. Consistent with prior years, the
excess tax benefit reflected in our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards will be accounted for as a credit to shareholders' equity, if
and when realized. In determining if and when excess tax benefits have been realized, we have elected to utilize the with-and-without approach with
respect to such excess tax benefits. We have also elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of stock-based compensation deductions for financial and
accounting reporting purposes, and specifically to recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from operations.
We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the
technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax
expense. Please refer to Note 13 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) components include
unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities, net of tax.
Net Income Per Share
Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income
per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury
stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the effect of stock options outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per
share for periods when their effect is anti-dilutive. Additionally, we issued convertible notes with a net settlement feature that requires us, upon
conversion, to settle the principal amount of debt for cash and the conversion premium for cash or shares of our common stock. Our convertible
notes, note hedges, and related warrants contain various conversion features, which are further described in Note 11 of these Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. The potentially dilutive shares resulting from the convertible notes and warrants under the treasury stock method
will be included in the calculation of diluted income per share when their inclusion is dilutive. However, unless actually exercised, the note hedges
will not be included in the calculation of diluted net income per share, as their pre-exercised effect would be anti-dilutive under the treasury stock
method.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time
of purchase to be cash equivalents. As of January 25, 2015 and January 26, 2014 , our cash and cash equivalents were $496.7 million and $1,151.6
million , respectively, which include $ 132.5 million and $307.9 million invested in money market funds for fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2014 ,
respectively.
Marketable Securities
Marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We generally
classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized
gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-
bearing securities includes accrued interest. Any unrealized losses which are considered to be other-than-temporary impairments are recorded in the
other income and expense section of our consolidated statements of income. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are
determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income and expense section of our consolidated statements of income.
All of our available-for-sale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value
is significantly below cost basis and judged to be other-than-temporary, or have other indicators of impairments. If the fair value of an available-for-
sale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis, an other-than-temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where (1) we intend to
sell the instrument, (2) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) a
credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument. In these situations, we recognize an other-than-
temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments’ amortized cost basis and its fair value. For available-
for-sale debt instruments that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss, if we do not intend to sell and it is
not more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis (amortized cost basis
less any current-period credit loss), we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other
factors. The credit loss component is recognized in earnings while loss related to all other factors is recorded as other comprehensive income.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their
relatively short maturities as of January 25, 2015 and January 26, 2014 . Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are
reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of
shareholders’ equity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities,
accounts receivable and the note hedge. Our investment policy requires the purchase of high grade investment securities, the diversification of asset
type and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration. All marketable securities are held in our name, managed by several investment managers
and held by one major financial institution under a custodial arrangement. Accounts receivable from significant customers, those representing 10% or
more of total accounts receivable, aggregated approximately 30% of our accounts receivable balance from two customers at January 25, 2015 and
approximately 23% of our accounts receivable balance from one customer at January 26, 2014 . We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our
customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific
customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and
letters of credit.

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
Accounts Receivable
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required
payments. We determine this allowance, which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on overall
estimated exposure. Factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables, the financial condition of our customers and the extent to
which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit.
Inventories
Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory
costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging,
manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the
cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the
lower of cost or estimated market value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to the write-
off of excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future
demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not
subsequently written-up.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the
estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and
accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to twenty
five years. Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded
under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.
Goodwill
Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment
exist. For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis.
For those reporting units where a significant change or event has occurred, where potential impairment indicators exist, or for which we have not
performed a quantitative assessment recently, we utilize a two-step quantitative assessment to testing goodwill for impairment. The first step tests for
possible impairment by applying a fair value-based test by weighing the results from the income approach and the market approach. The second step,
if necessary, measures the amount of such impairment by applying fair value-based tests to individual assets and liabilities. Please refer to Note 5 of
these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets primarily represent rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, acquired intellectual property, trademarks and customer
relationships and are subject to an annual impairment test. We currently amortize our intangible assets with definitive lives over periods ranging from
one to ten years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or,
if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset, or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and
used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset, or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset, or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge
is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group.
Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and
liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the
carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations
We account for asset retirement obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs.
The accounting guidance applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction,
development and/or normal use of the assets and requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period
in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the
associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. As of January 25, 2015 and January 26, 2014 , our asset
retirement obligations to return the leasehold improvements at our headquarters facility and certain laboratories at our domestic and international
facilities to their original condition upon lease termination were $7.4 million and $11.1 million , respectively.
Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update that creates a single source of revenue guidance under U.S. GAAP for all
companies, in all industries. Under the new standard, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in
an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new
guidance requires that reporting companies disclose the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts
with customers, including significant judgments and estimates used. This new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is not permitted. We will adopt this guidance either by
using a full retrospective approach for all periods presented in the period of adoption or a modified retrospective approach. We are currently
evaluating the impact of this accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined which transition method we
will apply.
Note 2 - Stock-Based Compensation
Our stock-based compensation expense is associated with stock options, RSUs, PSUs and our ESPP.
Our consolidated statements of income include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts capitalized as inventory, as follows:

During fiscal year 2015, we shifted away from granting stock options and toward granting RSUs and PSUs to reflect changing market trends for
equity incentives at our peer companies. The number of PSUs that will ultimately vest is contingent on the Company’s level of achievement versus
the corporate financial performance target established by our Compensation Committee in the beginning of each fiscal year. The number of shares of
our stock to be received at vesting typically ranges from 0% to 200% of the target amount.
Of the estimated total grant-date fair value, we estimated that the stock-based compensation expense related to the equity awards that are not
expected to vest for fiscal years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $36.6 million , $29.7 million and $27.1 million , respectively.

Valuation Assumptions
We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of RSUs
and PSUs. Compensation expense for RSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period, while
compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model.
We estimate the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a binomial model and recognize the expense using a straight-line
attribution method over the requisite employee service period.

We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our ESPP using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in
March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model.
The fair value of stock options granted under our stock option plans and shares issued under our ESPP have been estimated with the following
assumptions:

Dividend yield 1.7%-1.9% 2.0%-2.4% —
The expected life of employee stock options is a derived output of our valuation model and is impacted by the underlying assumptions of our
company. For ESPP shares, the expected term represents the average term from the first day of the offering period to the purchase date.
The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value stock options and ESPP is based upon observed interest rates on Treasury bills appropriate
for the expected term of the award.
Our expected stock price volatility assumption for stock options and ESPP is estimated using implied volatility.
For awards granted on or subsequent to November 8, 2012, we use a dividend yield at grant date, based on the per share dividends declared
during the most recent quarter. Our RSU and PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair value of RSUs and
PSUs is discounted by the dividend yield.
Additionally, for employee stock options and RSU and PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in
subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience.
Equity Incentive Program
We grant stock options, RSUs, PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the following equity incentive plans.
Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan
In 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2007 Plan. The 2007 Plan was amended and
restated in 2012, 2013 and 2014, or the Restated 2007 Plan.

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
The Restated 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock unit,
stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to employees, directors and
consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. With the 2014 amendment and restatement of the 2007 Plan, which increased
the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the 2007 Plan by 10,000,000 shares, up to 187,767,766 shares of our common
stock may be issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the Restated 2007 Plan. Currently, we grant stock options, RSUs and PSUs under the
Restated 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 25, 2015, there were 24,501,781 shares available for future issuance.
Stock options granted to employees, subject to certain exceptions, vest over a four year period, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on
the anniversary of the hire date in the case of new hires or the anniversary of the date of grant in the case of grants to existing employees and 6.25%
vesting at the end of each quarterly period thereafter. Options granted under the 2007 Plan generally expire ten years from the date of grant.
Subject to certain exceptions, RSUs granted to employees vest over a four year period, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on a pre-
determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 12.5% vesting semi-annually thereafter until fully vested.
PSUs granted to employees vest on a similar schedule, although the number of shares subject to PSUs that are eligible to vest is generally
determined by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of pre-determined criteria.
Unless terminated sooner, the Restated 2007 Plan is scheduled to terminate on March 21, 2022. Our Board may suspend or terminate the
Restated 2007 Plan at any time. No awards may be granted under the Restated 2007 Plan while the Restated 2007 Plan is suspended or after it is
terminated. The Board may also amend the Restated 2007 Plan at any time. However, if legal, regulatory or listing requirements require shareholder
approval, the amendment will not go into effect until the shareholders have approved the amendment.
PortalPlayer, Inc. 1999 Stock Option Plan
We assumed options issued under the PortalPlayer, Inc. 1999 Stock Option Plan, or the 1999 Plan, when we completed our acquisition of
PortalPlayer on January 5, 2007. As of January 25, 2015, there were no outstanding options to purchase NVIDIA common stock under the 1999 Plan
and we do not intend to grant future stock awards under the 1999 Plan as the plan expired on July 28, 2014.
1998 and 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plans
In February 1998, our Board approved the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 1998 Plan. At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held
on May 17, 2012, our shareholders approved the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2012 Plan, as the successor to the 1998 Plan. At the
Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on May 23, 2014, our shareholders approved an amendment and restatement of the 2012 Plan, or the Restated
2012 Plan.
Prior to the effective date of the 2012 Plan, we had authorized a total of 78,000,000 shares for issuance under the 1998 Plan, 54,567,667 shares
of which had been issued, 15,000,000 shares of which were reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding purchase rights and 8,432,333 shares of
which were available for future issuance. Upon its approval by our shareholders in 2012, the maximum aggregate number of shares that could be
issued under the 2012 Plan would not exceed 55,432,333 shares.
Effective upon the August 31, 2012 purchase date pursuant to the 1998 Plan, of the 15,000,000 shares which had been reserved for issuance
pursuant to outstanding purchase rights, 2,687,698 shares were issued pursuant to outstanding purchase rights, 183,000 shares were available but
reserved for future issuance, and the remaining 12,129,302 shares were moved into the share reserve of the 2012 Plan. Effective upon the final
February 28, 2013 purchase date pursuant to the 1998 Plan, 8,819 shares were issued pursuant to outstanding purchase rights, and the remaining
174,181 shares were moved into the share reserve of the 2012 Plan. With the 2014 amendment and restatement of the 2012 Plan, which increased the
share reserve of the Restated 2012 Plan by 12,500,000 shares, up to 65,235,816 shares of our common stock may be issued pursuant to purchases
under the Restated 2012 Plan. At January 25, 2015, we had issued 12,787,748 shares and reserved 52,448,068 shares for future issuance under the
Restated 2012 Plan.

The Restated 2012 Plan is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the
current offerings adopted pursuant to the Restated 2012 Plan, each offering period is 24 months, which is divided into four purchase periods of six
months .
Employees are eligible to participate if they are employed by us or an affiliate of us as designated by the Board. Employees who participate in an
offering may have up to 10% of their earnings withheld up to certain limitations and applied on specified dates determined by the Board to the
purchase of shares of common stock. The Board may increase this percentage at its discretion, up to 15% . The price of common stock purchased
under our ESPP will be equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each offering period
and the purchase date of each offering period. Employees may end their participation in the ESPP at any time during the offering period, and
participation ends automatically on termination of employment with us. In each case, the employee’s contributions are refunded.

Notes will not impact the denominator for diluted net income per share unless the average price of our common stock, as calculated under the terms
of the Notes, exceeds the conversion price of $20.16 per share. Likewise, the denominator for diluted net income per share will not include any effect
from the warrants unless the average price of our common stock, as calculated under the terms of the warrants, exceeds $27.14 per share.
The denominator for diluted net income per share for fiscal years 2015 and 2014 also does not include any effect from the convertible note hedge
transaction, or the Note Hedges. In future periods, the denominator for diluted net income per share will exclude any effect of the Note Hedges, as
their effect would be anti-dilutive. In the event an actual conversion of any or all of the Notes occurs, the shares that would be delivered to us under
the Note Hedges are designed to neutralize the dilutive effect of the shares that we would issue under the Notes. Please refer to Note 11 of these

Note 4 - 3dfx
During fiscal year 2002, we completed the purchase of certain assets from 3dfx Interactive, Inc., or 3dfx, for an aggregate purchase price of
$74.2 million . On December 15, 2000, NVIDIA Corporation and one of our indirect subsidiaries entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, or the
APA, which closed on April 18, 2001, to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx.
In October 2002, 3dfx filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California.
In March 2003, the Trustee appointed by the Bankruptcy Court to represent 3dfx’s bankruptcy estate served his complaint on NVIDIA. The Trustee’s
complaint asserted claims for, among other things, successor liability and fraudulent transfer and sought additional payments from us. In early
November 2005, NVIDIA and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, or the Creditors’ Committee, agreed to a Plan of Liquidation of 3dfx,
which included a conditional settlement of the Trustee’s claims against us. This conditional settlement was subject to a confirmation process through
a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the Bankruptcy Court. The conditional settlement called for a payment by NVIDIA of $30.6
million to the 3dfx estate. Under the settlement, $5.6 million related to various administrative expenses and Trustee fees, and $25.0 million related to
the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors of 3dfx. Accordingly, during the three month period ended October
30, 2005, we recorded $5.6 million as a charge to settlement costs and $25.0 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx. The Trustee advised that
he intended to object to the settlement.
The conditional settlement never progressed substantially through the confirmation process. On December 20, 2010, the District Court issued an
Order affirming the Bankruptcy Court's entry of summary judgment in NVIDIA's favor, and on January 19, 2011, the Trustee filed a Notice of
Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Oral argument on the appeal was held on October 8, 2014. On November 6, 2014,
the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision upholding the ruling of the Bankruptcy Court. As a result, we paid $5.6 million in related
legal expenses. The case concluded on February 5, 2015 and we reversed the $25.0 million liability for additional contingent consideration and
reduced the goodwill related to our 3dfx acquisition by the same amount as of January 25, 2015.
Please refer to Note 12 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this litigation.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
We allocate goodwill to our reporting units and perform our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if
indicators of potential impairment exist. For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative
analysis on a reporting unit basis. We utilized a quantitative analysis to complete our most recent annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of
fiscal year 2015 and concluded that there was no impairment, as the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values.
In a qualitative analysis, we evaluate factors including, but not limited to, macro-economic conditions, market and industry conditions, the
competitive environment, the operational stability and the overall financial performance of the reporting units, including cost factors and actual
revenue results. For reporting units in which the qualitative assessment concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying
value, no further goodwill impairment testing is required.
For those reporting units where a significant change or event has occurred, where potential impairment indicators exist, or for which we have not
performed a quantitative assessment recently, we utilize a two-step quantitative assessment to testing goodwill for impairment. The first step tests for
possible impairment by applying a fair value-based test by weighing the results from the income approach and the market approach. These valuation
approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, terminal or residual
values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and
estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.
When performing an income approach valuation, we incorporate the use of projected financial information and a discount rate that are developed
using market participant based assumptions to our discounted cash flow model. Our estimates of discounted cash flow were based upon, among other
things, certain assumptions about our expected future operating performance, such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, risk-adjusted discount
rates, and future economic and market conditions. The market method of determining the fair value of our reporting units requires us to use judgment
in the selection of appropriate market comparables.

Note 7 - Marketable Securities
All of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are classified as “available-for-sale” securities. Investments in both fixed and floating rate
interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a
rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future
investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity
investments is judged to be other-than-temporary. We may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due
to changes in interest rates. However, because any debt securities we hold are classified as “available-for-sale,” no gains or losses are realized in our
consolidated statement of income due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in market values
are determined to be other-than-temporary. These securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in
accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax.

We performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of January 25, 2015 . Factors considered included general market conditions,
the duration and extent to which fair value is below cost, and our intent and ability to hold an investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for
recovery in value. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for an investee, including
industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and changes in an investee’s credit rating.
Investments that we identify as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment was other than
temporarily impaired. Based on our quarterly impairment review and having considered the guidance in the relevant accounting literature, we
concluded that our investments were appropriately valued and that no other than temporary impairment charges were necessary on our portfolio of
available for sale investments as of January 25, 2015 .

As of January 25, 2015 , we had nine investments that were in an unrealized loss position with total unrealized losses amounting to $2.4 million
and with a duration of less than one year. The gross unrealized losses related to fixed income securities were due to changes in interest rates. We have
determined that the gross unrealized losses on investment securities at January 25, 2015 are temporary in nature. Currently, we have the intent and
ability to hold our investments with impairment indicators until maturity.
Net realized gains were $0.1 million , $2.4 million and $0.5 million for fiscal years 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. As of January 25,
2015 , we had a net unrealized gain of $8.4 million , which was comprised of gross unrealized gains of $11.0 million , offset by $2.6 million of gross
unrealized losses. As of January 26, 2014 , we had a net unrealized gain of $4.8 million , which was comprised of gross unrealized gains of $7.2

Note 8 - Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities
Financial assets measured at fair value
We measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value. The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined
using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets. Our Level 1 assets consist of our money
market funds. We classify securities within Level 1 assets when the fair value is obtained from real time quotes for transactions in active exchange
markets involving identical assets. Our available-for-sale securities are classified as having Level 2 inputs. Our Level 2 assets are valued utilizing a
market approach where the market prices of similar assets are provided by a variety of independent industry standard data providers to our
investment custodian. We review the fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs may
result in a reclassification of levels for certain securities within the fair value hierarchy. There were no significant transfers between Levels 1 and 2
assets for the year ended January 25, 2015 . Level 3 assets are based on unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology and include our own data
about assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available under the circumstances.
Most of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are valued based on Level 2 inputs. We did not have any investments classified as Level 3 as
of January 25, 2015 .

Financial liabilities measured at fair value
We issued $1.50 billion Convertible Senior Notes, or Notes, in December 2013. The Notes are carried at their original issuance value, net of
unamortized debt discount, and are not marked to market each period. The estimated fair value of the Notes was $1,679.6 million and $1,528.4
million , respectively, as of January 25, 2015 and January 26, 2014. The estimated fair value of the Notes was determined on the basis of market
prices observable for similar instruments and is considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Please refer to Note 11 of these Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Notes.

Note 10 - Guarantees
U.S. GAAP requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes
under that guarantee. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued, including a tabular reconciliation of
the changes of the entity’s product warranty liabilities.
Accrual for Product Warranty Liabilities
We record a reduction to revenue for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized primarily based on historical return rates. Cost
of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers
for certain products. Additionally, we accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.
During periods prior to fiscal year 2013, we recorded a cumulative net charge of $475.9 million , most of which was charged against cost of revenue,
to cover customer warranty, repair, return, replacement and other costs arising from a weak die/packaging material set in certain versions of our
previous generation MCP and GPU products used in notebook configurations. During fiscal year 2014, we released the remaining $7.8 million
unclaimed balance of that warranty accrual.
The estimated product returns and estimated product warranty liabilities for fiscal years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 are as follows:

(1) Includes a balance of $9.6 million and $13.2 million for fiscal years 2014 and 2013 , respectively, for the remaining amount of the warranty
accrual associated with incremental repair and replacement costs from a weak die/packaging material set, which we recorded prior to fiscal year
2013.
(2) Includes $1.8 million and $3.0 million for fiscal years 2014 and 2013 , respectively, in payments related to weak die/packaging set warranty
accrual recorded prior to fiscal year 2013, and $7.8 million related to the release of the final unclaimed portion of that accrual during fiscal year
2014.
In connection with certain agreements that we have executed in the past, we have at times provided indemnities to cover the indemnified party
for matters such as tax, product and employee liabilities. We have also on occasion included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our
technology related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not
have a maximum stated liability. As such, we have not recorded any liability in our Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications.

Note 11 - Long-Term Debt
1.00 % Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018
On December 2, 2013, we issued $1.50 billion of the Notes. The Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of the Company, which pay
interest in cash semi-annually at a rate of 1.00% per annum. The Notes will mature on December 1, 2018 unless earlier repurchased or converted in
accordance with their terms prior to such date. The Notes may be converted, under the conditions specified below, based on an initial conversion rate
of 49.60 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of $20.16 per share of common
stock), subject to adjustment as described in the indenture governing the Notes.
Holders may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to August 1, 2018 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal
quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ended on April 27, 2014 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of the
common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day
of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the
five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the measurement period) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal
amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock
and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after August 1, 2018 to the close of
business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their notes
regardless of the foregoing conditions. Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay
or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election, in respect
of the remainder, if any, of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted.
As of January 25, 2015 , none of the conditions allowing holders of the Notes to convert had been met. The determination of whether or not the
Notes are convertible must be performed quarterly. If the Notes become convertible at the option of the holder, the difference between the principal
amount and the carrying value of the Notes would be reflected as convertible debt in the mezzanine equity section on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets.
In accordance with ASC 470-20 Debt with Conversion and Other Options , all cash-settled convertible debt should be separated into debt and
equity components at issuance and be assigned a fair value. The value assigned to the debt component is the estimated fair value, as of the issuance
date, of a similar debt without the conversion feature. The difference between the net cash proceeds and this estimated fair value, represents the value
assigned to the equity component and is recorded as a debt discount. The debt discount is amortized using the effective interest method from the
origination date through its stated contractual maturity date.
The initial debt component of the Notes was valued at $1,351.8 million based on the contractual cash flows discounted at an appropriate market
rate for a non-convertible debt at the date of issuance, which was determined to be 3.15% . The carrying value of the permanent equity component
reported in additional paid-in-capital was valued at $125.7 million and recorded as a debt discount. This amount, together with the $22.5 million
purchaser's discount to the par value of the Notes represents the total unamortized debt discount of $148.2 million we recorded at the time of issuance
of the Notes. The aggregate debt discount is amortized as interest expense over the contractual term of the Notes using the effective interest method
using an interest rate of 3.15% .

Note Hedges and Warrants
The net proceeds from the Notes were approximately $1,477.5 million after payment of the initial purchaser's discount. Concurrently with the
offering of the Notes, we entered into the Note Hedges with a strike price equal to the initial conversion price of the Notes, or approximately $20.16
per share. The Note Hedges allow us to receive shares of our common stock and/or cash related to the excess conversion value that we would pay to
the holders of the Notes upon conversion. We paid $167.1 million for the Note Hedges.
In addition, concurrent with the offering of the Notes and the purchase of the Note Hedges, we entered into a separate warrant transaction, or the
Warrants, with a strike price to the holders of the Warrants of $27.14 per share. The Warrants are net share settled and cover, subject to customary
antidilution adjustments, 74.4 million shares of our common stock. We received $59.1 million for the Warrants transaction.
The $108.0 million net cost of the Note Hedges offset by the proceeds from the Warrants was included as a net reduction to additional paid-in
capital in the shareholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheets, in accordance with the guidance in ASC 815-40 Derivatives and

Litigation
3dfx
On December 15, 2000, NVIDIA and one of our indirect subsidiaries entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, or APA, to purchase certain
graphics chip assets from 3dfx. The transaction closed on April 18, 2001. In October 2002, 3dfx filed for bankruptcy.
Following the bankruptcy, in March 2003, the Trustee appointed by the Bankruptcy Court to represent 3dfx's bankruptcy estate served a
complaint on NVIDIA asserting claims for, among other things, successor liability and fraudulent transfer and seeking additional payments from us.
The Trustee's fraudulent transfer theory alleged that NVIDIA had failed to pay reasonably equivalent value for 3dfx's assets, and sought recovery of
the difference between the $70.0 million paid and the alleged fair value, which difference the Trustee estimated to exceed $50.0 million . The
Trustee's successor liability theory alleged NVIDIA was effectively 3dfx's legal successor and therefore was responsible for all of 3dfx's unpaid
liabilities.
In early November 2005, after several months of mediation, NVIDIA and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, or the Creditors'
Committee, agreed to a Plan of Liquidation of 3dfx, which included a conditional settlement of the Trustee's claims against us. This conditional
settlement was subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the Bankruptcy Court. The conditional
settlement never progressed substantially through the confirmation process.
In March 2007, a trial was held regarding certain valuation issues in the Trustee's constructive fraudulent transfer claims against NVIDIA. On
April 30, 2008, the Bankruptcy Court issued its Memorandum Decision After Trial, in which it provided a detailed summary of the trial proceedings
and the parties' contentions and evidence and concluded that “the creditors of 3dfx were not injured by the Transaction.” This decision did not
entirely dispose of the Trustee's action, however, as the Trustee's claims for successor liability and intentional fraudulent conveyance were still
pending. On June 19, 2008, NVIDIA filed a motion for summary judgment to convert the Memorandum Decision After Trial to a final judgment.
That motion was granted in its entirety and judgment was entered in NVIDIA's favor on September 11, 2008. The Trustee filed a Notice of Appeal
from that judgment on September 22, 2008, and on September 25, 2008, NVIDIA exercised its election to have the appeal heard by the United States
District Court.
On December 20, 2010, the District Court issued an Order affirming the Bankruptcy Court's entry of summary judgment in NVIDIA's favor, and
on January 19, 2011, the Trustee filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Oral argument on the appeal
was held on October 8, 2014. On November 6, 2014, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision upholding the ruling of the Bankruptcy
Court and the case concluded on February 5, 2015.

Securities Cases
In September 2008, three putative securities class actions were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California
arising out of our announcements on July 2, 2008, that we would take a charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated costs and expenses arising
from a weak die/packaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation MCP and GPU products and that we were revising financial
guidance for our second quarter of fiscal year 2009. The actions purport to be brought on behalf of purchasers of NVIDIA stock and assert claims for
violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
On January 22, 2010, Plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint, asserting claims for violations of Section 10(b), Rule
10b-5, and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and seeking unspecified compensatory damages. We moved to dismiss the consolidated
complaint and on October 19, 2010, Judge Seeborg granted our motion with leave to amend. On December 2, 2010, Plaintiffs filed a Second
Consolidated Amended Complaint. We again moved to dismiss and on October 12, 2011, Judge Seeborg again granted our motion to dismiss, this
time denying Plaintiffs leave to amend. On November 8, 2011, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal to the Ninth Circuit. Oral argument was held on
January 14, 2014. On October 2, 2014, the Ninth Circuit issued an order affirming the dismissal. On October 16, 2014, Plaintiffs requested a
rehearing or en banc review of the Ninth Circuit’s opinion affirming the dismissal. Plaintiffs’ request was denied on November 10, 2014. On
February 9, 2015, Plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court.
Patent Infringement Cases
On September 4, 2014, NVIDIA filed complaints against Qualcomm, Inc., or Qualcomm, and various Samsung entities with both the United
States International Trade Commission, or ITC, and the United States District Court for the District of Delaware for alleged infringement of seven
patents relating to graphics processing. In the ITC action, NVIDIA seeks to block shipments of Samsung Galaxy mobile phones and tablets
containing Qualcomm’s Adreno, ARM’s Mali or Imagination’s PowerVR graphics architectures. On October 6, 2014, the ITC initiated an
investigation of NVIDIA’s claim and the investigation is currently underway. On February 2 and 3, 2015, the court conducted a claim construction
hearing on certain claim language from five of the patents at issue. A decision on claim construction is expected in March 2015.
In the Delaware action, NVIDIA seeks unspecified damages for Samsung and Qualcomm’s alleged patent infringement. On October 22, 2014,
Samsung and Qualcomm moved to stay the Delaware proceedings in light of the pending ITC action. The court granted the motion to stay on
October 23, 2014.
On November 10, 2014, Samsung filed a complaint against NVIDIA and Velocity Micro, Inc., in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Virginia, alleging that NVIDIA infringed six patents and falsely advertised that the Tegra K1 processor is the world’s fastest mobile
processor. On December 19, 2014, Samsung filed an amended, longer complaint but asserting the same claims against NVIDIA. Samsung seeks
unspecified damages and an injunction prohibiting NVIDIA from any future violations. NVIDIA answered the amended complaint on January 26,
2015 and filed an amended answer on March 3, 2015. On January 12, 2015, NVIDIA moved to transfer the action to the Northern District of
California and to sever and stay the proceedings against Velocity Micro, Inc. Briefing on the motion to transfer is now complete and submitted to the
court for decision.
Accounting for Loss Contingencies
While there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe the claims made by other parties in the above ongoing matters are without
merit and we intend to vigorously defend the actions. As of January 25, 2015, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated
with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, any possible range of loss in
these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in other legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of
its business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a
material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.

Net deferred tax liability $ (165,609) $ (86,218)
We recognized income tax expense of $124.2 million , $70.3 million and $99.5 million during fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
Income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes, or our annual effective tax rate, was 16.5% in fiscal year 2015, 13.8% in fiscal year 2014
and 15.0% in fiscal year 2013. The difference in the effective tax rates amongst the three years was primarily due to an increase in the amount of
earnings subject to United States tax in fiscal year 2015 and a higher percentage of research tax credit benefit in fiscal year 2014.
Our effective tax rate on income before tax for the fiscal years was lower than the United States federal statutory rate of 35% due to income
earned in jurisdictions, including British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, where the tax rate is lower, favorable
recognition of the U.S. federal research tax credit and release of tax reserves as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitations in certain non-U.S.
jurisdictions for which we had not previously recognized related tax benefits.
As of January 25, 2015 and January 26, 2014 we had a valuation allowance of $261.0 million and $244.5 million , respectively, related to state
and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to projections of future taxable income. To
the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit
during the period.
Our deferred tax assets do not include the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation that are a component of our federal and state
net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards in the amount of $411.9 million as of January 25, 2015. Consistent with prior years, the
excess tax benefit reflected in our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards will be accounted for as a credit to shareholders' equity, if
and when realized.

As of January 25, 2015, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $521.5 million , $667.2 million and $332.6
million , respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will expire beginning in fiscal year 2022 and 2016, respectively. The foreign net operating
loss carryforwards of $316.7 million may be carried forward indefinitely and the remainder of $15.9 million will begin to expire in fiscal year 2016.
As of January 25, 2015, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $429.6 million that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2018. We have state
research tax credit carryforwards of $411.7 million , of which $395.9 million is attributable to the State of California and may be carried over
indefinitely, and $15.8 million is attributable to various other states and will expire beginning in fiscal year 2016. We have other state tax credit
carryforwards of $3.0 million that will expire in fiscal year 2026 and foreign tax credit carryforwards of $18.4 million , which may be refunded in
fiscal years 2016 through 2019 if not utilized. Our tax attributes, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, remain subject to audit and may be
adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances. Utilization of federal,
state, and foreign net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may also be subject to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations
provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state and foreign tax provisions. If any such limitations apply, the federal, states, or foreign net
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, as applicable, may expire or be denied before utilization.
As of January 25, 2015, U.S. federal and state income taxes have not been provided on approximately $2.27 billion of undistributed earnings of
non-United States subsidiaries as such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. We have not provided the amount of unrecognized
deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in our foreign subsidiaries as the determination of such amount is not
practicable.
As of January 25, 2015, we had $253.7 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $228.7 million would affect our effective tax rate if
recognized. However, approximately $45.3 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax positions taken, that, if
recognized, would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that would likely attract a full valuation allowance. The $228.7 million of
unrecognized tax benefits as of January 25, 2015 consisted of $106.6 million recorded in non-current income taxes payable and $122.1 million
reflected as a reduction to the related deferred tax assets.
A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
January 25, January 26, January 27,
2015 2014 2013

Balance at beginning of period $ 237,738 $ 220,543 $ 138,262

Lapse in statute of limitations (5,997 ) (4,878) (3,979)
Balance at end of period $ 253,735 $ 237,738 $ 220,543
We classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or as a reduction of the deferred tax assets or amount refundable, to the extent that
we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes within one year. Likewise, the amount is classified as a long-term liability, reduction of
long-term deferred tax assets or amount refundable, if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year.
Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of January 25,
2015, January 26, 2014, and January 27, 2013, we had accrued $14.4 million , $12.9 million and $11.3 million , respectively, for the payment of
interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not included as a component of our unrecognized tax benefits. As of January 25,
2015, non-current income taxes payable of $121.0 million consisted of unrecognized tax benefits of $106.6 million and the related interest and
penalties of $14.4 million.
While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our
accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised
estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. As of January 25, 2015, we do not believe that our estimates, as
otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.

Note 14 - Shareholders’ Equity
Share Repurchase Program
Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock. Most
recently, in November 2013, the Board extended the previously authorized repurchase program through January 2016 and authorized an additional
$1.00 billion for an aggregate of $3.70 billion under the repurchase program.
During fiscal year 2015, we repurchased a total of 44.4 million shares of our common stock for $813.6 million and paid $186.5 million in cash
dividends - equivalent to $0.085 per share on a quarterly basis, or $0.34 per share on an annual basis - to our common shareholders. As a result, we
returned $1.0 billion to shareholders during fiscal year 2015 in the form of share repurchases and dividend payments.
Through the end of fiscal year 2015, we have repurchased an aggregate of 205.6 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total
cost of $3,265.2 million . All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. As of January 25, 2015, we are
authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $434.8 million through January 2016.
On November 6, 2014, we announced our intention to return approximately $600.0 million to our shareholders in fiscal year 2016 through a
combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. On February 11, 2015, we declared that we would pay our next quarterly cash dividend of
$0.085 per share on March 19, 2015, to all shareholders of record on February 26, 2015.
In addition to our Board authorized share repurchases, we withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax
withholding obligations upon the vesting of RSU and PSU awards under our equity incentive program. During fiscal year 2015, we withheld
approximately 2.3 million shares at a total cost of $43.7 million through net share settlements. Please refer to Note 2 of these Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding stock-based compensation related to equity awards granted under our equity
incentive programs.
Convertible Preferred Stock
As of January 25, 2015 and January 26, 2014 , there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding.
Note 15 - Employee Retirement Plans
We have a 401(k) Retirement Plan covering substantially all of our United States employees. Under the plan, participating employees may defer
up to 100% of their pre-tax earnings, subject to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limits. Effective January 2013, we began matching
a portion of the employee contributions. Our contribution expense in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 was $5.8 million and $5.1 million , respectively. We
also have defined contribution retirement plans outside of the United States to which we contributed $19.7 million , $16.2 million and $16.7 million
for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Note 16 - Segment Information
Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on
an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. Our operating segments are equivalent
to our reportable segments.
We report our business in two primary reporting segments - the GPU business and the Tegra Processor business - based on a single underlying
graphics architecture.
Our GPU product brands aimed at specialized markets include GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla for researchers, deep learning
and big-data analysts; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users.
We also integrate our GPUs into tiny mobile chips called system-on-a-chip (SOC) processors, which power tablets, and automotive infotainment
and safety systems. Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, incorporating GPUs and multi-core CPUs with audio, video
and input/output capabilities. They can also be integrated with baseband processors to add voice and data communication. Tegra conserves power
while delivering state-of-the-art graphics and multimedia processing.
We have a single unifying architecture for our GPU and Tegra Processors. This architecture unification leverages our visual computing expertise
by charging the operating expenses of certain core engineering functions to the GPU business, while charging the Tegra Processor business for the
incremental cost of the teams working directly for that business. In instances where the operating expenses of certain functions benefit both reporting
segments, our CODM assigns 100% of those expenses to the reporting segment that benefits the most. The revenue and cost of revenue of the
reporting segments was not affected, and comparative periods presented below reflect the impact of this change.
The “All Other” category presented below represents the revenue and expenses that our CODM does not assign to either the GPU business or the
Tegra Processor business for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The revenue includes primarily patent
licensing revenue and the expenses include corporate infrastructure and support costs, stock-based compensation costs, amortization of acquisition-
related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in
nature.

NVIDIA Corporation
Amended & Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan
Deferred Restricted Stock Unit Agreement
Pursuant to the Deferred Restricted Stock Unit Grant Notice (“ Grant Notice ”) and this Deferred Restricted Stock
Unit Agreement (collectively, the “ Agreement ”), NVIDIA Corporation (the “ Company ”) has awarded you a Restricted
Stock Unit Award (the “ Award ”) under its Amended & Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the “ Plan ”).
1. Grant of the Award. The Award represents the right to be issued on a future date one share of Common
Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit that vests under this Award, subject to the terms and conditions provided in this
Agreement and in the Plan. As of the Date of Grant, the Company will credit to a bookkeeping account maintained by the
Company for your benefit (the “ Account ”) the number of RSUs subject to the Award. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, you will not be required to make any payment to the Company (other than past and future services to the
Company or an Affiliate) with respect to your receipt of the Award, the vesting of the RSUs or the delivery of the
underlying Common Stock.
2. Vesting. Subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement, your Award will vest, if at all, in
accordance with the vesting schedule provided in the Grant Notice, provided that vesting will cease upon the termination of
your Continuous Service (subject to any acceleration provided for in the Agreement or the Plan). On the termination of your
Continuous Service, the RSUs credited to the Account that were not vested on the date of such termination will be forfeited
and returned to the Company at no cost to the Company and you will have no further right, title or interest in or to such
RSUs or the underlying shares of Common Stock.
3. Number of Shares.
(a) The number of RSUs (and the related shares of Common Stock) subject to your Award will be
adjusted from time to time for Capitalization Adjustments, as provided in the Plan.
(b) Any RSUs, shares, cash or other property that becomes subject to the Award as a result of a
Capitalization Adjustment, if any, will be subject to the same forfeiture restrictions, restrictions on transferability, and time
and manner of delivery as applicable to the other shares covered by your Award.
(c) No fractional shares or rights for fractional shares of Common Stock will be created by this Section
3. The Board will round down, to the nearest whole share or whole unit of rights, any fractional shares or rights for
fractional shares.
4. Securities Law Compliance. You will not be issued any shares under your Award unless either (a) the
shares are registered under the Securities Act; or (b) the Company has determined that such issuance would be exempt from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Your Award also must comply with other applicable laws and regulations
governing the Award, and you will not receive such shares if the Company determines that such receipt would not be in
material compliance with such laws and regulations.
5. Limitations on Transfer. Your Award is not transferable, except by will or by the laws of descent and
distribution. In addition to any other limitation on transfer created by applicable securities laws, you agree not to assign,
hypothecate, donate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any interest in any of the shares of Common Stock subject to the
Award until the shares are issued to you. After the shares have been issued to you, you are free to assign, hypothecate,
donate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any interest in such shares provided that any such actions are in compliance with
the provisions in this Agreement and applicable securities laws. If permitted by the Board, you may, by delivering written
notice to the Company, in a form satisfactory to the Company, designate a third party who, in the event of your death, will
thereafter be entitled to receive any distribution of Common Stock to which you were entitled at the time of your death
pursuant to this Agreement.
6. Date of Issuance. In the event that one or more RSUs vests, the Company will issue to you one (1) share of
Common Stock for each RSU on the Settlement Date determined under the Grant Notice, but in all cases not later than
December 31 of the calendar year in which the Settlement Date occurs.
7. Dividends. You will receive no benefit or adjustment to your Award and any unissued shares thereunder
with respect to any cash dividend, stock dividend or other distribution that does not result from a Capitalization Adjustment.
Following the date of vesting, in the event of any cash dividend, stock dividend or other distribution that does not result
from a Capitalization Adjustment, no cash, stock or other property related to such dividend or distribution will be issuable in
respect of your vested RSUs.
8. Restrictive Legends. The shares issued under your Award will be endorsed with appropriate legends if
determined by the Company that legends are required under applicable law or otherwise.
9. Award not a Service Contract.
(a) Your Continuous Service with the Company or an Affiliate is not for any specified term and may
be terminated by you or by the Company or an Affiliate at any time, for any reason, with or without cause and with or
without notice. Nothing in this Agreement (including, but not limited to, the vesting of your Award pursuant to the schedule
set forth in Section 2 in this Agreement or the issuance of the shares subject to your Award), the Plan or any covenant of
good faith and fair dealing that may be found implicit in this Agreement or the Plan will: (i) confer upon you any right to
continue in the employ of, or affiliation with, the Company or an Affiliate; (ii) constitute any promise or commitment by the
Company or an Affiliate regarding the fact or nature of future positions, future work assignments, future compensation or
any other term or condition of employment or affiliation; (iii) confer any right or benefit under this Agreement or the Plan
unless such right or benefit has specifically accrued under the terms of this Agreement or Plan; or (iv) deprive the Company
or an Affiliate of the right to terminate you at will and without regard to any future vesting opportunity that you may have.
(b) By accepting this Award, you acknowledge and agree that the right to continue vesting in the
Award is earned only through Continuous Service (not through the act of being hired, being granted this Award or any other
award or benefit) and that the Company has the right to reorganize, sell, spin-out or otherwise restructure one or more of its
businesses or Affiliates at any time or from time to time, as it deems appropriate (a “ reorganization ”). You further
acknowledge and agree that such a reorganization could result in the termination of your Continuous Service, or the
termination of Affiliate status of your employer and the loss of benefits available to you under this Agreement, including but
not limited to, the termination of the right to continue vesting in the Award. You further acknowledge and agree that this
Agreement, the Plan, the transactions contemplated hereunder and the vesting schedule set forth in this Agreement or any
covenant of good faith and fair dealing that may be found implicit in any of them do not constitute an express or implied
promise of continued engagement as an Employee, Director or Consultant for the term of this Agreement,
for any period, or at all, and will not interfere in any way with your right or the Company’s or an Affiliate’s right to
terminate your Continuous Service at any time, with or without cause and with or without notice.
10. Withholding Obligations. On or before the time you receive a distribution of the cash, shares or other
property subject to your Award, or at any time thereafter as reasonably requested by the Company in compliance with
applicable law, you hereby authorize any required withholding from the Common Stock issuable to you and/or otherwise
agree to make adequate provision in cash for any sums required to satisfy the federal, state, local and foreign tax
withholding obligations of the Company or any Affiliate which arise in connection with your Award (the “ Withholding
Taxes ”). Without limiting the foregoing, the Company or an Affiliate, or their respective agents, may, in their sole
discretion, satisfy all or any portion of the Withholding Taxes obligation relating to your Award by any of the following
means or by a combination of such means: (i) withholding from any compensation otherwise payable to you by the
Company; (ii) causing you to tender a cash payment; (iii) permitting you to enter into a “same day sale” commitment with a
broker-dealer that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (a “ FINRA Dealer ”) whereby you
irrevocably elect to sell a portion of the shares to be delivered under the Award to satisfy the Withholding Taxes and
whereby the FINRA Dealer irrevocably commits to forward the proceeds necessary to satisfy the Withholding Taxes
directly to the Company and/or its Affiliates, including a commitment pursuant to a previously established Company-
approved 10b5-1 plan, and/or (iv) if approved by the Board in a manner that complies with applicable laws, withholding
shares of Common Stock from the shares of Common Stock issued or otherwise issuable to you in connection with the
Award with a Fair Market Value (measured as of the date shares of Common Stock are issued to pursuant to Section 6)
equal to the amount necessary to satisfy the Company’s required tax withholding obligations using the minimum statutory
withholding rates for federal, state, local and foreign tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to
supplemental taxable income. Unless the Withholding Taxes obligations of the Company and/or any Affiliate are satisfied,
the Company will have no obligation to deliver to you any Common Stock.
11. Unsecured Obligation. Your Award is unfunded, and as a holder of a vested Award, you will be
considered an unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to the Company’s obligation, if any, to issue shares pursuant
to this Agreement. You will not have voting or any other rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to the shares
to be issued pursuant to this Agreement until such shares are issued to you. Upon such issuance, you will obtain full voting
and other rights as a stockholder of the Company. Nothing contained in this Agreement, and no action taken pursuant to its
provisions, will create or be construed to create a trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between you and the Company
or any other person.
12. Other Documents . You hereby acknowledge receipt or the right to receive a document providing the
information required by Rule 428(b)(1) promulgated under the Securities Act, which includes the Plan prospectus. In
addition, you acknowledge receipt of the Company’s policy permitting certain individuals to sell shares only during certain
“window” periods and the Company’s insider trading policy, in effect from time to time and understand that this policy
applies to shares received under this Award.
13. Notices; Electronic Delivery. Any notices provided for in your Award or the Plan will be given in
writing and will be deemed effectively given upon receipt or, in the case of notices delivered by the Company to you, five
(5) days after deposit in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to you at the last address you provided to the
Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents and
transmit or require you to transmit notices related to participation in the Plan and this Award by electronic means. You
hereby consent to receive such documents and notices, and to give such notices, by electronic delivery and to participate in
the Plan through the on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or another third party
designated by the Company from time to time.
14. Miscellaneous.
(a) The rights and obligations of the Company under your Award will be transferable to any one or
more persons or entities, and all covenants and agreements hereunder will inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the
Company’s successors and assigns. Your rights and obligations under your Award may only be assigned with the prior
written consent of the Company.
(b) You agree upon request to execute any further documents or instruments necessary or desirable in
the sole determination of the Company to carry out the purposes or intent of your Award.
(c) You acknowledge and agree that you have reviewed your Award in its entirety, have had an
opportunity to obtain the advice of counsel prior to executing and accepting your Award, and fully understand all provisions
of your Award.
(d) This Agreement will be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals
by any governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required.
(e) All obligations of the Company under the Plan and this Agreement will be binding on any
successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger,
consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company.
15. Governing Plan Document. Your Award is subject to all the provisions of the Plan, the provisions of
which are hereby made a part of your Award, and is further subject to all interpretations, amendments, rules and regulations
which may from time to time be promulgated and adopted pursuant to the Plan.
16. Severability. If all or any part of this Agreement or the Plan is declared by any court or governmental
authority to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity will not invalidate any portion of this Agreement or the
Plan not declared to be unlawful or invalid. Any Section of this Agreement (or part of such a Section) so declared to be
unlawful or invalid will, if possible, be construed in a manner which will give effect to the terms of such Section or part of a
Section to the fullest extent possible while remaining lawful and valid.
17. Effect on Other Employee Benefit Plans. The value of the Award subject to this Agreement will not be
included as compensation, earnings, salaries, or other similar terms used when calculating your benefits under any employee
benefit plan sponsored by the Company or any Affiliate, except as such plan otherwise expressly provides. The Company
expressly reserves its rights to amend, modify, or terminate any of the Company’s or any Affiliate’s employee benefit plans.
18. Choice of Law. The interpretation, performance and enforcement of this Agreement will be governed by
the law of the state of Delaware without regard to such state’s conflicts of laws rules.
19. Amendment. This Agreement may not be modified, amended or terminated except by an instrument in
writing, signed by you and by a duly authorized representative of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
Agreement may be amended solely by the Board by a writing which specifically states that it is amending this Agreement,
so long as a copy of such amendment is delivered to you, and provided that no such amendment adversely affecting your
rights hereunder may be made without your written consent. Without limiting the foregoing, the Board reserves the right to
change, by written notice to you, the provisions of this Agreement in any way it may deem necessary or advisable to carry
out the purpose of the grant as a
result of any change in applicable laws or regulations or any future law, regulation, ruling, or judicial decision, provided that
any such change will be applicable only to rights relating to that portion of the Award which is then subject to restrictions as
provided in this Agreement.
20. Compliance with Section 409A of the Code . This Award is intended to comply with U.S. Treasury
Regulation Section 1.409A-3(a) and will be construed and administered in such a manner, and any ambiguous or missing
terms that may otherwise be supplied from and/or defined under Code Section 409A in a manner that fulfills such intention
hereby incorporated by reference. Each installment of RSUs that vests hereunder is intended to constitute a “separate
payment” for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). If you are a Specified Employee on your Separation
from Service, then the issuance of any shares, cash or other property that would otherwise be made on the date of your
Separation from Service (or within the first six months thereafter as a result of your Separation from Service) will not be
made on the originally scheduled date(s) and will instead be issued in a lump sum on the earlier of (i) the date that is six
months and one day after the date of the Separation from Service or (ii) the date of your death, but if and only if such delay
in the issuance is necessary to avoid the imposition of taxation on you in respect of the shares, cash or property under Code
Section 409A.
21. No Obligation to Minimize Taxes. The Company has no duty or obligation to minimize the tax
consequences to you of this Award and will not be liable to you for any adverse tax consequences to you arising in
connection with this Award. You are hereby advised to consult with your own personal tax, financial and/or legal advisors
regarding the tax consequences of this Award and by accepting this Award, you have agreed that you have done so or
knowingly and voluntarily declined to do so.

Nothing in this Agreement (including, but not limited to, the vesting of your Award pursuant to the schedule set forth in Section 2 in
this Agreement or the issuance of the shares subject to your Award), the Plan or any covenant of good faith and fair dealing that may be
found implicit in this Agreement or the Plan will: (i) confer upon you any right to continue in the employ of, or affiliation with, the

in the Award. You further acknowledge and agree that this Agreement, the Plan, the transactions contemplated hereunder and the

Agreement, for any period, or at all, and will not interfere in any way with your right or the Company’s or an Affiliate’s right to
terminate your Continuous Service at any time, with or without cause and with or without notice.
10. Withholding Obligations. On or before the time you receive a distribution of the cash, shares or other property
subject to your Award, or at any time thereafter as reasonably requested by the Company in compliance with applicable law, you
hereby authorize any required withholding from the Common Stock issuable to you and/or otherwise agree to make adequate provision
in cash for any sums required to satisfy the federal, state, local and foreign tax withholding obligations of the Company or any Affiliate
which arise in connection with your Award (the “ Withholding Taxes ”). Without limiting the foregoing, the Company or an Affiliate,
or their respective agents, may, in their sole discretion, satisfy all or any portion of the Withholding Taxes obligation relating to your
Award by any of the following means or by a combination of such means: (i) withholding from any compensation otherwise payable to
you by the Company; (ii) causing you to tender a cash payment; (iii) permitting you to enter into a “same day sale” commitment with a

Taxes directly to the Company and/or its Affiliates, including a commitment pursuant to a previously established Company-approved
10b5-1 plan, and/or (iv) if approved by the Board in a manner that complies with applicable laws, withholding shares of Common Stock
from the shares of Common Stock issued or otherwise issuable to you in connection with the Award with a Fair Market Value
(measured as of the date shares of Common Stock are issued to pursuant to Section 6) equal to the amount necessary to satisfy the
Company’s required tax withholding obligations using the minimum statutory withholding rates for federal, state, local and foreign tax
purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to supplemental taxable income. Unless the Withholding Taxes obligations of the
Company and/or any Affiliate are satisfied, the Company will have no obligation to deliver to you any Common Stock.
11. Unsecured Obligation. Your Award is unfunded, and as a holder of a vested Award, you will be considered an
unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to the Company’s obligation, if any, to issue shares pursuant to this Agreement. You
will not have voting or any other rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to the shares to be issued pursuant to this
Agreement until such shares are issued to you. Upon such issuance, you will obtain full voting and other rights as a stockholder of the

trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between you and the Company or any other person.

governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required.
(e) All obligations of the Company under the Plan and this Agreement will be binding on any successor to the
Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of
all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company.
15. Governing Plan Document. Your Award is subject to all the provisions of the Plan, the provisions of which are
hereby made a part of your Award, and is further subject to all interpretations, amendments, rules and regulations which may from time
to time be promulgated and adopted pursuant to the Plan.
16. Severability. If all or any part of this Agreement or the Plan is declared by any court or governmental authority to
be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity will not invalidate any portion of this Agreement or the Plan not declared to be
unlawful or invalid. Any Section of this Agreement (or part of such a Section) so declared to be unlawful or invalid will, if possible, be
construed in a manner which will give effect to the terms of such Section or part of a Section to the fullest extent possible while

17. Effect on Other Employee Benefit Plans. The value of the Award subject to this Agreement will not be included
as compensation, earnings, salaries, or other similar terms used when calculating your benefits under any employee benefit plan

rights to amend, modify, or terminate any of the Company’s or any Affiliate’s employee benefit plans.
18. Choice of Law. The interpretation, performance and enforcement of this Agreement will be governed by the law of

amendment is delivered to you, and provided that no such amendment adversely affecting your rights hereunder may be made without
your written consent. Without limiting the foregoing, the Board reserves the right to change, by written notice to you, the provisions of
this Agreement in any way it may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purpose of the grant as a result of any change in
applicable laws or regulations or any future law, regulation, ruling, or judicial decision, provided that any such change will be
applicable only to rights relating to that portion of the Award which is then subject to restrictions as provided in this Agreement.
20. Compliance with Section 409A of the Code . This Award is intended to comply with U.S. Treasury Regulation
Section 1.409A-3(a) and will be construed and administered in such a manner, and any ambiguous or missing terms that may otherwise
be supplied from and/or defined under Code Section 409A in a manner that fulfills such intention hereby incorporated by reference.
Each installment of RSUs that vests hereunder is intended to constitute a “separate payment” for purposes of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). If you are a Specified Employee on your Separation from Service, then the issuance of any shares, cash or
other property that would otherwise be made on the date of your Separation from Service (or within the first six months thereafter as a
result of your Separation from Service) will not be made on the originally scheduled date(s) and will instead be issued in a lump sum on
the earlier of (i) the date that is six months and one day after the date of the Separation from Service or (ii) the date of your death, but if
and only if such delay in the issuance is necessary to avoid the imposition of taxation on you in respect of the shares, cash or property
under Code Section 409A.
21. No Obligation to Minimize Taxes. The Company has no duty or obligation to minimize the tax consequences to
you of this Award and will not be liable to you for any adverse tax consequences to you arising in connection with this Award. You are
hereby advised to consult with your own personal tax, financial and/or legal advisors regarding the tax consequences of this Award and
by accepting this Award, you have agreed that you have done so or knowingly and voluntarily declined to do so.

Attachment I
NVIDIA Corporation
Amended & Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan
Restricted Stock Unit Agreement
Pursuant to the Restricted Stock Unit Grant Notice (“ Grant Notice ”) and this Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (collectively,
the “ Agreement ”), NVIDIA Corporation (the “ Company ”) has awarded you a Restricted Stock Unit Award (the “ Award ”) under its
Amended & Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the “ Plan ”).
1. Grant of the Award. The Award represents the right to be issued on a future date one share of Common
Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit that vests under this Award, subject to the terms and conditions provided in this
Agreement and in the Plan. As of the Date of Grant, the Company will credit to a bookkeeping account maintained by the
Company for your benefit (the “ Account ”) the number of RSUs subject to the Award. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, you will not be required to make any payment to the Company (other than past and future services to the Company
or an Affiliate) with respect to your receipt of the Award, the vesting of the RSUs or the delivery of the underlying Common
Stock.
2. Vesting. Subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement, your Award will vest, if at all, in accordance with
the vesting schedule provided in the Grant Notice, provided that vesting will cease upon the termination of your Continuous Service
(subject to any acceleration provided for in the Agreement or the Plan). On the termination of your Continuous Service, the RSUs
credited to the Account that were not vested on the date of such termination will be forfeited and returned to the Company at no cost to
the Company and you will have no further right, title or interest in or to such RSUs or the underlying shares of Common Stock.
3. Number of Shares.
(a) The number of RSUs (and the related shares of Common Stock) subject to your Award will be adjusted
from time to time for Capitalization Adjustments, as provided in the Plan.
(b) Any RSUs, shares, cash or other property that becomes subject to the Award as a result of a Capitalization
Adjustment, if any, will be subject to the same forfeiture restrictions, restrictions on transferability, and time and manner of delivery as
applicable to the other shares covered by your Award.
(c) No fractional shares or rights for fractional shares of Common Stock will be created by this Section 3. The
Board will round down, to the nearest whole share or whole unit of rights, any fractional shares or rights for fractional shares.
4. Securities Law Compliance. You will not be issued any shares under your Award unless either (a) the shares are
registered under the Securities Act; or (b) the Company has determined that such issuance would be exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. Your Award also must comply with other applicable laws and regulations governing the Award, and
you will not receive such shares if the Company determines that such receipt would not be in material compliance with such laws and
regulations.
5. Limitations on Transfer. Your Award is not transferable, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
In addition to any other limitation on transfer created by applicable securities laws, you agree not to assign, hypothecate, donate,
encumber or otherwise dispose of any interest in any of the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award until the shares are issued to
you. After the shares have been issued to you, you are free to assign, hypothecate, donate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any
interest in such shares provided that any such actions are in compliance with the provisions in this Agreement and applicable securities
laws. If permitted by the Board, you may, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form satisfactory to the Company,
designate a third party who, in the event of your death, will thereafter be entitled to receive any distribution of Common Stock to which
you were entitled at the time of your death pursuant to this Agreement.
6. Date of Issuance. In the event that one or more RSUs vests, the Company will issue to you one (1) share of
Common Stock for each vested RSU on the applicable vesting date, but in all cases not later than the date necessary for compliance
with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4).
7. Dividends. You will receive no benefit or adjustment to your Award and any unissued shares thereunder with respect
to any cash dividend, stock dividend or other distribution that does not result from a Capitalization Adjustment. Following the date of
vesting, in the event of any cash dividend, stock dividend or other distribution that does not result from a Capitalization Adjustment, no
cash, stock or other property related to such dividend or distribution will be issuable in respect of your vested RSUs.
8. Restrictive Legends. The shares issued under your Award will be endorsed with appropriate legends if determined
by the Company that legends are required under applicable law or otherwise.
9. Award not a Service Contract.
(a) Your Continuous Service with the Company or an Affiliate is not for any specified term and may be
terminated by you or by the Company or an Affiliate at any time, for any reason, with or without cause and with or without notice.
Nothing in this Agreement (including, but not limited to, the vesting of your Award pursuant to the schedule set forth in Section 2 in
this Agreement or the issuance of the shares subject to your Award), the Plan or any covenant of good faith and fair dealing that may be
found implicit in this Agreement or the Plan will: (i) confer upon you any right to continue in the employ of, or affiliation with, the
Company or an Affiliate; (ii) constitute any promise or commitment by the Company or an Affiliate regarding the fact or nature of
future positions, future work assignments, future compensation or any other term or condition of employment or affiliation; (iii) confer
any right or benefit under this Agreement or the Plan unless such right or benefit has specifically accrued under the terms of this
Agreement or Plan; or (iv) deprive the Company or an Affiliate of the right to terminate you at will and without regard to any future
vesting opportunity that you may have.
(b) By accepting this Award, you acknowledge and agree that the right to continue vesting in the Award is
earned only through Continuous Service (not through the act of being hired, being granted this Award or any other award or benefit)
and that the Company has the right to reorganize, sell, spin-out or otherwise restructure one or more of its businesses or Affiliates at any
time or from time to time, as it deems appropriate (a “ reorganization ”). You further acknowledge and agree that such a
reorganization could result in the termination of your Continuous Service, or the termination of Affiliate status of your employer and
the loss of benefits available to you under this Agreement, including but not limited to, the termination of the right to continue vesting
in the Award. You further acknowledge and agree that this Agreement, the Plan, the transactions contemplated hereunder and the
vesting schedule set forth in this Agreement or any covenant of good faith and fair dealing that may be found implicit in any of them do
not constitute an express or implied promise of continued engagement as an Employee, Director or Consultant for the term of this
Agreement, for any period, or at all, and will not interfere in any way with your right or the Company’s or an Affiliate’s right to
terminate your Continuous Service at any time, with or without cause and with or without notice.
10. Withholding Obligations. On or before the time you receive a distribution of the cash, shares or other property
subject to your Award, or at any time thereafter as reasonably requested by the Company in compliance with applicable law, you
hereby authorize any required withholding from the Common Stock issuable to you and/or otherwise agree to make adequate provision
in cash for any sums required to satisfy the federal, state, local and foreign tax withholding obligations of the Company or any Affiliate
which arise in connection with your Award (the “ Withholding Taxes ”). Without limiting the foregoing, the Company or an Affiliate,
or their respective agents, may, in their sole discretion, satisfy all or any portion of the Withholding Taxes obligation relating to your
Award by any of the following means or by a combination of such means: (i) withholding from any compensation otherwise payable to
you by the Company; (ii) causing you to tender a cash payment; (iii) permitting you to enter into a “same day sale” commitment with a
broker-dealer that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (a “ FINRA Dealer ”) whereby you irrevocably elect to
sell a portion of the shares to be delivered under the Award to satisfy the Withholding Taxes and whereby the FINRA Dealer
irrevocably commits to forward the proceeds necessary to satisfy the Withholding Taxes directly to the Company and/or its Affiliates,
including a commitment pursuant to a previously established
Company-approved 10b5-1 plan, and/or (iv) if approved by the Board in a manner that complies with applicable laws, withholding
shares of Common Stock from the shares of Common Stock issued or otherwise issuable to you in connection with the Award with a
Fair Market Value (measured as of the date shares of Common Stock are issued to pursuant to Section 6) equal to the amount necessary
to satisfy the Company’s required tax withholding obligations using the minimum statutory withholding rates for federal, state, local
and foreign tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to supplemental taxable income. Unless the Withholding Taxes
obligations of the Company and/or any Affiliate are satisfied, the Company will have no obligation to deliver to you any Common
Stock.
11. Unsecured Obligation. Your Award is unfunded, and as a holder of a vested Award, you will be considered an
unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to the Company’s obligation, if any, to issue shares pursuant to this Agreement. You
will not have voting or any other rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to the shares to be issued pursuant to this
Agreement until such shares are issued to you. Upon such issuance, you will obtain full voting and other rights as a stockholder of the
Company. Nothing contained in this Agreement, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, will create or be construed to create a
trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between you and the Company or any other person.
12. Other Documents . You hereby acknowledge receipt or the right to receive a document providing the information
required by Rule 428(b)(1) promulgated under the Securities Act, which includes the Plan prospectus. In addition, you acknowledge
receipt of the Company’s policy permitting certain individuals to sell shares only during certain “window” periods and the Company’s
insider trading policy, in effect from time to time and understand that this policy applies to shares received under this Award.
13. Notices; Electronic Delivery. Any notices provided for in your Award or the Plan will be given in writing and will
be deemed effectively given upon receipt or, in the case of notices delivered by the Company to you, five (5) days after deposit in the
United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to you at the last address you provided to the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents and transmit or require you to transmit notices related to
participation in the Plan and this Award by electronic means. You hereby consent to receive such documents and notices, and to give
such notices, by electronic delivery and to participate in the Plan through the on-line or electronic system established and maintained by
the Company or another third party designated by the Company from time to time.
14. Miscellaneous.
(a) The rights and obligations of the Company under your Award will be transferable to any one or more
persons or entities, and all covenants and agreements hereunder will inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the Company’s
successors and assigns. Your rights and obligations under your Award may only be assigned with the prior written consent of the
Company.
(b) You agree upon request to execute any further documents or instruments necessary or desirable in the sole
determination of the Company to carry out the purposes or intent of your Award.
(c) You acknowledge and agree that you have reviewed your Award in its entirety, have had an opportunity to
obtain the advice of counsel prior to executing and accepting your Award, and fully understand all provisions of your Award.
(d) This Agreement will be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any
governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required.
(e) All obligations of the Company under the Plan and this Agreement will be binding on any successor to the
Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of
all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company.
15. Governing Plan Document. Your Award is subject to all the provisions of the Plan, the provisions of which are
hereby made a part of your Award, and is further subject to all interpretations, amendments, rules and regulations which may from time
to time be promulgated and adopted pursuant to the Plan.
16. Severability. If all or any part of this Agreement or the Plan is declared by any court or governmental authority to
be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity will not invalidate any portion of this Agreement or the Plan not declared to be
unlawful or invalid. Any Section of this Agreement (or part of such a Section) so declared to be unlawful or invalid will, if possible, be
construed in a manner which will give effect to the terms of such Section or part of a Section to the fullest extent possible while
remaining lawful and valid.
17. Effect on Other Employee Benefit Plans. The value of the Award subject to this Agreement will not be included
as compensation, earnings, salaries, or other similar terms used when calculating your benefits under any employee benefit plan
sponsored by the Company or any Affiliate, except as such plan otherwise expressly provides. The Company expressly reserves its
rights to amend, modify, or terminate any of the Company’s or any Affiliate’s employee benefit plans.
18. Choice of Law. The interpretation, performance and enforcement of this Agreement will be governed by the law of
the state of Delaware without regard to such state’s conflicts of laws rules.
19. Amendment. This Agreement may not be modified, amended or terminated except by an instrument in writing,
signed by you and by a duly authorized representative of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be
amended solely by the Board by a writing which specifically states that it is amending this Agreement, so long as a copy of such
amendment is delivered to you, and provided that no such amendment adversely affecting your rights hereunder may be made without
your written consent. Without limiting the foregoing, the Board reserves the right to change, by written notice to you, the provisions of
this Agreement in any way it may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purpose of the grant as a result of any change in
applicable laws or regulations or any future law, regulation, ruling, or judicial decision, provided that any such change will be
applicable only to rights relating to that portion of the Award which is then subject to restrictions as provided in this Agreement.
20. Compliance with Section 409A of the Code . This Award is intended to comply with U.S. Treasury Regulation
Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) and thus to not be treated as “deferred compensation”, and will be construed and administered in such a
manner, and any ambiguous or missing terms that may otherwise be supplied from and/or defined under Code Section 409A in a
manner that fulfills such intention hereby incorporated by reference. Each installment of RSUs that vests hereunder is intended to
constitute a “separate payment” for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). If you are a “specified employee” (as
determined under Code Section 409A) on your Separation from Service, then the issuance of any shares, cash or other property that
would otherwise be made on the date of your Separation from Service (or within the first six months thereafter as a result of your
Separation from Service) will not be made on the originally scheduled date(s) and will instead be issued in a lump sum on the earlier of
(i) the date that is six months and one day after the date of the Separation from Service or (ii) the date of your death, but if and only if
such delay in the issuance is necessary to avoid the imposition of taxation on you in respect of the shares, cash or property under Code
Section 409A.
21. No Obligation to Minimize Taxes. The Company has no duty or obligation to minimize the tax consequences to
you of this Award and will not be liable to you for any adverse tax consequences to you arising in connection with this Award. You are
hereby advised to consult with your own personal tax, financial and/or legal advisors regarding the tax consequences of this Award and
by accepting this Award, you have agreed that you have done so or knowingly and voluntarily declined to do so.
