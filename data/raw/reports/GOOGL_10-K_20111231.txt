ITEM 1.BUSINESS
Overview
Google is a global technology leader focused on improving the ways people connect with information. W e aspire to
build products that improve the lives of billions of people globally . Our mission is to organize the worlds information and
make it universally accessible and useful. Our innovations in web search and advertising have made our website a top
internet property and our brand one of the most recognized in the world.
We generate revenue primarily by delivering relevant, cost-ef fective online advertising. Businesses use our AdW ords
program to promote their products and services with targeted advertising. In addition, the third parties that comprise the
Google Network use our AdSense program to deliver relevant ads that generate revenue and enhance the user experience.
We were incorporated in California in September 1998 and reincorporated in Delaware in August 2003. Our
headquarters are located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway , Mountain V iew, California 94043, and our telephone number is
(650) 253-0000. W e completed our initial public of fering in August 2004 and our Class A common stock is listed on the
Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol GOOG.
Corporate Highlights
On April 4, 201 1, Larry Page, our Co-Founder , assumed day-to-day operations as our Chief Executive Of ficer. Since
then, Larrys primary focus has been on increasing Googles velocity and executionmaking things much simpler for our
users and improving the overall Google experience while continually creating new products with the potential to improve the
lives of billions of people.
Android The growth of our Android operating system in 201 1 has been impressive. As of January 2012, over
250million Android devices have been activated globally .
Improved Ad Formats We made a number of ad improvements in 201 1. For instance, with visual ads, not only can
users find theater times for a new movie, users can watch the trailer directly in the ad. Location-aware search ads
can help users find what they are looking for more easily by putting thousands of local businesses on the
mapliterally . With the +1 button, people can find businesses recommended by their friends. After all, ads are just
more answers to users queries.
Google+ In June 201 1, we launched Google+, a new way to share online just like users do in the real world,
sharing dif ferent things with dif ferent people. Google+ has added new users every week since its launch. As of
January 2012, over 90 million people have joined Google+.
Product Prioritization In an ef fort to prioritize our product ef forts, we decided to shut down a number of products in
2011, including Google Buzz, Google Desktop, and Google Labs. W e learned a lot from these discontinued
products and are putting that learning to work every day in new products such as Google+.
New and Improved Google Experience Constant revision and improvement is part of our overarching philosophy .
In 201 1, we began work on improving the Google experience guided by three key design principles:
FocusWith the new design changes, we have brought forward the things that matter to users and moved all
the other clutter out of their way so that users can better focus on what they need at the moment.
ElasticityThe new design allows users to seamlessly transition from one device to another from the various
mobile devices, tablets, high-resolution monitors, and TVs to access the web and have a consistent visual
experience.
EffortlessnessOur design philosophy is to combine power with simplicity . We want to keep our look simple
and clean, but behind the seemingly simple design, use technologies like HTML5, W ebGL, and the latest,
fastest browsers to make sure users have all the power of the web behind them.

On August 15, 201 1, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with Motorola, a provider
of innovative technologies, products and services that enable a range of mobile and wireline digital communication,
information and entertainment experiences, under which we will acquire Motorola for $40 per share in cash, or a total of
approximately $12.5 billion. The completion of this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the
receipt of certain regulatory approvals.
Our business is primarily focused around the following key areas: search, advertising, operating systems and
platforms, and enterprise.
Search
We maintain a vast index of websites and other online content, and make it available through our search engine to
anyone with an internet connection. Our search technologies sort through an ever-growing amount of information to deliver
relevant and useful search results in response to user queries. W e integrate innovative features into our search service and
offer specialized search services to help users tailor their search. In addition, we are constantly improving and adding to our
products and services, to provide users with more relevant results so that users find what they are looking for faster .
In January 2012, we launched Search plus Y our W orld. Now , when a user performs a signed-in search on Google, the
users results page may include Google+ content from people that the user is close to (or might be interested in following).
Relevant Google+ profiles and Google+ pages related to a specific topic or area of interest may also appear on a users
results page.
Advertising
Google Search . The goal of AdW ords, our primary auction-based advertising program, is to deliver ads that are so
useful and relevant to search queries or web content that they are a form of information in their own right. With AdW ords,
advertisers create simple text-based ads that then appear beside related search results or web content on our websites and
on thousands of partner websites in our Google Network, which is the network of third parties that use our advertising
programs to deliver relevant ads with their search results and content. Most of our AdW ords customers pay us on a cost-
per-click basis, which means that an advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on one of its ads. W e also of fer AdW ords
on a cost-per-impression basis that enables advertisers to pay us based on the number of times their ads appear on our
websites and our Google Network Members websites as specified by the advertiser .
Our AdSense program enables websites that are part of the Google Network to deliver ads from our AdW ords
advertisers that are relevant to the search results or content on their websites. W e share the majority of the revenues
generated from these ads with the Google Network Members that display the ads. The AdSense program enables
advertisers to extend the reach of their ad campaigns, improves our partners ability to generate revenue from their
content, and delivers relevant ads for their users.
Google Display . Display advertising comprises the videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across the
web on computers and mobile devices, including smart phones and handheld computers such as netbooks and tablets. The
Google Display Network provides advertisers services related to the delivery of display advertising across publishers
participating in our AdSense program, publishers participating in the DoubleClick Ad Exchange, and Google-owned sites
such as Y ouTube and Google Finance.
Through our DoubleClick advertising technology , we provide to publishers, agencies, and advertisers the ad serving
technology , which is the infrastructure that enables billions of ads to be served each day across the web. Our DoubleClick
Ad Exchange creates a real-time auction marketplace for the trading of display ad space. W e aim to simplify display
advertising so it is easier for advertisers and publishers to manage campaigns across dif ferent formats, on dif ferent
websites, and for dif ferent devices.

In addition, Y ouTube provides a range of video, interactive, and other ad formats for advertisers to reach their intended
audience. Y ouTubes video advertising solutions give advertisers a way to promote their content to the Y ouTube
community , as well as to associate with content being watched by their target audience. Y ouTube also of fers analytic tools
to help advertisers understand their audience and derive general business intelligence. In the past year , YouTube has
experienced strong growth in mobile viewers and has established key partnerships with content companies to help
monetize mobile video.
Google Mobile. Mobile advertising is still in relative infancy , though the mobile device is quickly becoming the worlds
newest gateway to information. Google is focused on developing easy-to-use ad products to help advertisers extend their
reach, help create revenue opportunities for our publisher partners, and deliver relevant and useful ads to users on the go.
Google Mobile extends our products and services by providing mobile-specific features to mobile device users. Our
mobile-specific search technologies include search by voice, search by sight, and search by location. Google Mobile also
optimizes a large number of Googles applications for mobile devices in both browser and downloadable form. In addition,
we of fer advertisers the ability to run search ad campaigns on mobile devices with popular mobile-specific ad formats, such
as click-to-call ads in which advertisers can include a phone number within ad text. In 2010, we acquired AdMob, Inc.
(AdMob), which of fers ef fective ad units and solutions for application developers and advertisers. W e continue to invest in
improving users access to Google services through their mobile devices.
Google Local. Google is committed to providing users with relevant local information. W eve organized information
around more than 50 million places globally from various sources across the web. Users can find addresses, phone
numbers, hours of operation, directions and more for millions of local queries like shops, restaurants, parks and landmarks
right on Google.com, on Google Maps and on Google Maps for mobile. They can also discover more places that are right
for them by rating the places theyve been, and getting customized recommendations based on their tastes and those of
their friends directly within Google Maps. Our products and services also help local business owners manage their online
presence and connect with potential customers. Millions of business owners have verified their free business listings via
Google Places to ensure that users have up-to-date information about their establishments, and to contribute additional
details such as photos and products/services of fered. Google Of fers brings people daily deals from local and national
businesses, redeemable for discounted goods or services. From restaurants to spa treatments to outdoor adventures,
Google has deals from the best businesses a city has to of fer as well as popular national brands.
Operating Systems and Platforms
Android. Working closely with the Open Handset Alliance, a business alliance of more than 75 technology and mobile
companies, we developed Android, a free, fully open source mobile software platform that any developer can use to create
applications for mobile devices and any handset manufacturer can install on a device. W e believe Android will drive greater
innovation and choice in the mobile device ecosystem, and provide consumers with a more powerful mobile experience.
Google Chrome OS and Google Chrome. Google Chrome OS is an open source operating system with the Google
Chrome web browser as its foundation. Both the Google Chrome OS and the Google Chrome browser are built around the
core tenets of speed, simplicity , and security . Designed for people who spend most of their time on the web, the Google
Chrome OS is a new approach to operating systems. W e are working with several original equipment manufacturers to
bring computers running Google Chrome OS to users and businesses. The Chrome browser runs on Windows, Mac, and
Linux computers.
Google+ . In June 201 1, we launched Google+, a new way to share online just like users do in the real world, sharing
different things with dif ferent people. Google+ has added new users every week since its launch. As of January 2012, over
90million people have joined Google+.

Google TV . Google TV is a platform that gives consumers the power to experience television and the internet on a
single screen, with the ability to search and find the content they want to watch. The Google TV platform is based on the
Android operating system and runs the Google Chrome browser .
Google Books. The Google Books platform (including reading applications, an electronic bookstore (eBookstore), book
search, and personal library management) is designed to help people discover , search, and consume content from printed
books online. Through the Google eBookstore, we make available for sale popular books in electronic book format to
complement our large collection of free public domain books.
Enterprise
Googles enterprise products provide familiar , easy-to-use Google technology for business settings. Through Google
Apps, which includes Gmail, Google Docs, Google Calendar , and Google Sites, among other features, we provide hosted,
web-based applications that people can use on any device with a browser and an internet connection. In addition, we
provide our search technology for use within enterprises through the Google Search Appliance (real-time search of
business applications, intranet applications, and public websites), on their public-facing sites with Google Site Search
(custom search engine), and Google Commerce Search (for online retail enterprises). W e also provide versions of our
Google Maps Application Programming Interface (API) for businesses (including fully interactive Google Maps for public
and internal websites), as well as Google Earth Enterprise (a behind-the-company-firewall software solution for imagery and
data visualization). Our enterprise solutions have been adopted by a variety of businesses, governments, schools, and non-
profit organizations. Google Apps is the first cloud computing suite of message and collaboration tools to receive U.S.
government security certification.
Research
We continue to develop new products and services and to enhance our existing ones through research and product
development and the licensing and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology . Our product development
philosophy is to launch innovative products early and often, and then iterate rapidly to make those products even better . We
often post early stage products at test locations online or directly on Google.com. W e then use data and user feedback to
decide if and how to invest further in those products.
Our research and development expenses were $2.8 billion, $3.8 billion, and $5.2 billion in 2009, 2010, and 201 1,
respectively , which included stock-based compensation expense of $725 million, $861 million, and $1.1 billion, respectively .
We expect to continue to invest in building the employee and systems infrastructures needed to support the development of
new products and services and to improve existing ones.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions,
to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. W e have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and
international trademarks, service marks, domain names, and copyrights. Additionally , we have filed U.S. and international
patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology . Over time, we have assembled a portfolio of patents,
trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names, and trade secrets covering our products and services. Our
proprietary technology is not dependent on any single patent or copyright or groups of related patents or copyrights. W e
believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products. Although we rigorously protect
our proprietary technology , any significant impairment of, or third-party claim against, our intellectual property rights could
harm our business or our ability to compete.
Sales and Support

specialized teams across vertical markets. We bring businesses into our advertising network through direct, remote, and
online sales channels, using technology and automation wherever possible to improve our customers experience and to
grow our business cost-ef fectively . Our direct advertising and sales teams focus on building relationships with the largest
advertisers and leading internet companies. W e have built a multi-product sales force, with teams selling campaigns that
include search, display (including DoubleClick and Y ouTube), and mobile advertising.
We provide customer service to our advertiser base through our global support organization. Our global support
organization concentrates on helping our advertisers and Google Network Members get the most out of their relationship
with us.
No individual customer or groups of af filiated customers represented more than 10% of our revenues in 2009, 2010, or
2011.
Government Contracts
No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at
the election of the U.S. government.
Marketing
Googles global brand is well known. W e believe that building a trusted, highly recognized brand begins with providing
high-quality products and services that make a notable dif ference in peoples lives. Marketing is responsible for generating
advertiser revenue through marketing campaigns to small businesses, as well as providing thought leadership to chief
marketing of ficers through industry insight, research, and analysis. Our marketing, promotional, and public relations
activities are designed to promote Googles brand image and dif ferentiate it from competitors.
Competition
Our business is characterized by rapid change and converging, as well as new and disruptive, technologies. W e face
formidable competition in every aspect of our business, particularly from companies that seek to connect people with
information on the web and provide them with relevant advertising. W e face competition from:
General purpose search engines, such as Y ahoo and Microsofts Bing.
Vertical search engines and e-commerce websites, such as Kayak (travel queries), Monster .com (job queries),
WebMD (for health queries), and Amazon.com and eBay (e-commerce). Some users will navigate directly to such
websites rather than go through Google.
Social networks, such as Facebook and T witter . Some users are relying more on social networks for product or
service referrals, rather than seeking information through general purpose search engines.
Other forms of advertising, such as television, radio, newspapers, magazines, billboards, and yellow pages, for ad
dollars. Our advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and of fline.
Mobile applications on iPhone and Android devices, which allow users to access information directly from a
publisher without using search engines.
Providers of online products and services. A number of our online products and services, including Gmail,
YouTube, and Google Docs, compete directly with new and established companies, which of fer communication,
information, and entertainment services integrated into their products or media properties.

We compete to attract and retain users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away , primarily on
the basis of the relevance and usefulness of our search results and the features, availability , and ease of use of our
products and services.
We also compete to attract and retain content providers (Google Network Members, as well as other content providers
for whom we distribute or license content), primarily based on the size and quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help
these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.
Government Regulation
We are subject to numerous domestic and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matter . New
laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations) may also impact our business. The costs of
compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future and any failure on our part to
comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties.
Culture and Employees
We take great pride in our culture. W eembrace collaboration and creativity ,and encourage the iteration of ideas to
address complex technical challenges. T ransparency and open dialog are central to us, and we like to ensure that company
news reaches our employees first through internal channels.
Despite our rapid growth, we still cherish our roots as a startup and give employees the freedom to act on their ideas
regardless of role or function within the company . We strive to hire the best employees, with backgrounds and perspectives
as diverse as our global users. W e provide an environment where these talented people can have fulfilling careers working
on some of the biggest challenges in technology , and have a huge, positive impact on the world.
At December 31, 201 1, we had 32,467 full-time employees, consisting of 1 1,665 in research and development, 1 1,933
in sales and marketing, 4,651 in general and administrative, and 4,218 in operations. All of Googles full-time employees
are also equityholders, with significant collective employee ownership. Although we have works councils and statutory
employee representation obligations in certain countries, our employees are not represented by a labor union and we
consider our employee relations to be good. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, particularly for
software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staf f.
Global Operations and Geographic Data
We provide our products and services in more than 100 languages and in more than 50 countries, regions, and
territories. On www .google.com or one of our other Google domains, users can find information in many dif ferent languages
and in many dif ferent formats. The United States accounted for approximately 46% of our revenues in 201 1. Information
regarding financial data by geographic areas is set forth in Item 7 and Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note

Our business is af fected by both seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality . Internet
usage generally slows during the summer months, and commercial queries typically increase significantly in the fourth
quarter of each year . These seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly
results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.

ITEM 1A.RISK F ACTORS
Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below ,
which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our
Class A common stock.
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
We face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to
users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.
Our business is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and is subject to changing technology , shifting user needs,
and frequent introductions of new products and services. W e have many competitors in dif ferent industries, including
general purpose search engines, vertical search engines and e-commerce sites, social networking sites, traditional media
companies, and providers of online products and services. Our current and potential competitors range from large and
established companies to emerging start-ups. Established companies have longer operating histories and more established
relationships with customers and users, and they can use their experience and resources in ways that could af fect our
competitive position, including by making acquisitions, investing aggressively in research and development, aggressively
initiating intellectual property claims (whether or not meritorious) and competing aggressively for advertisers and websites.
Emerging start-ups may be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can.
Our success depends on providing products and services that make using the internet a more useful and enjoyable
experience for our users. Our competitors are constantly developing innovations in web search, online advertising, and
web-based products and services. As a result, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and
development, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our web search technology and our existing products and
services, and introduce new products and services that people can easily and ef fectively use. If we are unable to provide
quality products and services, then our users may become dissatisfied and move to a competitors products and services.
In addition, these new products and services may present new and dif ficult technology challenges, and we may be subject
to claims if users of these of ferings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. Our operating results
would also suf fer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our users, advertisers, and Google Network
Members, are not appropriately timed with market
9

opportunities, or are not ef fectively brought to market. As search technology continues to develop, our competitors may be
able to of fer search results that are, or that are seen to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. This may force us to
compete in dif ferent ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive. If our competitors are more
successful than we are in developing compelling products or in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, and content
providers, our revenues and operating results could be adversely af fected.
Our ongoing investment in new business strategies and new products, services, and technologies is inherently risky , and
could disrupt our ongoing businesses.
We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new business strategies, products, services, and technologies.
Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current
operations, insuf ficient revenues to of fset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments,
inadequate return of capital on our investments, and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence of such
strategies and of ferings. Because these new ventures are inherently risky , no assurance can be given that such strategies
and of ferings will be successful and will not materially adversely af fect our reputation, financial condition, and operating
results.
We generate our revenues almost entirely from advertising, and the reduction in spending by or loss of advertisers could
seriously harm our business.
We generated 96% of our revenues in 201 1 from our advertisers. Our advertisers can generally terminate their
contracts with us at any time. Advertisers will not continue to do business with us if their investment in advertising with us
does not generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, or if we do not deliver their advertisements in an appropriate and
effective manner . If we are unable to remain competitive and provide value to our advertisers, they may stop placing ads
with us, which would negatively af fect our revenues and business.
In addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and
buying patterns. Adverse economic conditions can have a material negative impact on the demand for advertising and
cause our advertisers to reduce the amounts they spend on advertising, which could negatively impact our revenues and
business.
Our revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the
future .
Our revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition,
the challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, and the increasing maturity of the
online advertising market and the other markets in which we participate. W e believe our operating margin will experience
downward pressure as a result of increasing competition and increased expenditures for many aspects of our business. Our
operating margin will also experience downward pressure if a greater percentage of our revenues comes from ads placed
on our Google Network Members websites compared to revenues generated through ads placed on our own websites or if
we spend a proportionately larger amount to promote the distribution of certain products, including Google Chrome. The
margin on revenues we generate from our Google Network Members is significantly less than the margin on revenues we
generate from advertising on our websites. Additionally , the margin we earn on revenues generated from our Google
Network Members could decrease in the future if we pay an even larger percentage of advertising fees to our Google
Network Members.
We are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny that may negatively impact our business.
The growth of our company and our expansion into a variety of new fields implicate a variety of new regulatory issues,
and we have experienced increased regulatory scrutiny as we have grown. In particular , we are cooperating with the U.S.
Federal T rade Commission (FTC), the European Commission (EC) and several state

attorneys general in investigations they are conducting with respect to our business and its impact on competition.
Legislators and regulators, including those conducting investigations in the U.S. and Europe, may make legal and
regulatory changes, or interpret and apply existing laws, in ways that make our products and services less useful to our
users, require us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil or criminal liability , or cause us to change our
business practices. These changes or increased costs could negatively impact our business and results of operations in
material ways.
We are involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.
We are regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition and
antitrust (such as the pending investigations by the FTC and the EC), intellectual property , privacy , tax, labor and
employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services of fered by advertisers or publishers
using our platforms, and other matters. Such claims, suits, government investigations, and proceedings are inherently
uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty . Regardless of the outcome, such legal proceedings can have
an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. Determining
reserves for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment. It is possible that a
resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties that could adversely af fect our
business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in a particular period. These proceedings
could also result in criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from of fering certain features,
functionalities, products, or services, requiring a change in our business practices, or requiring development of non-
infringing products or technologies, which could also adversely af fect our business and results of operations.
Our business depends on a strong brand, and failing to maintain and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to expand
our base of users, advertisers, Google Network Members, and other partners.
The brand identity that we have developed has significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining
and enhancing the Google brand is critical to expanding our base of users, advertisers, Google Network Members, and
other partners. W e believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase due to the relatively low barriers to entry in
the internet market. Our brand may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including data privacy and security
issues, service outages, and product malfunctions. If we fail to maintain and enhance the Google brand, or if we incur
excessive expenses in this ef fort, our business, operating results, and financial condition will be materially and adversely
affected. Maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to be a technology leader and continue to
provide high-quality products and services, which we may not do successfully .
Acquisitions and investments could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other harmful consequences that may
adversely impact our business and results of operations.
Acquisitions are an important element of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital, and we expect our current
pace of acquisitions to continue. These transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations.
We also expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions.
The process of integrating an acquired company , business, or technology has created, and will continue to create,
unforeseen operating dif ficulties and expenditures. The areas where we face risks include:
Diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges.
Implementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company .
Integration of the acquired companys accounting, human resource, and other administrative systems, and
coordination of product, engineering, and sales and marketing functions.
Transition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms.
11
Copyright © 2013 www .secdatabase.com . All Rights Reserved.
Please Consider the Environment Before Printing This DocumentTable of Contents
Failure to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a timely
basis, if it all, which could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise
restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition.
In the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across dif ferent cultures and languages and to
address the particular economic, currency , political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.
Failure to successfully further develop the acquired technology .
Cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization, and
retention of employees from the businesses we acquire.
Liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement
claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities.
Litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company , including claims from terminated employees,
customers, former stockholders, or other third parties.
Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and
investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated
liabilities, and harm our business generally .
Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent
liabilities, or amortization expenses, or write-of fs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. Also, the
anticipated benefit of many of our acquisitions may not materialize.
A variety of new and existing U.S. and foreign laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business .
We are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. New
laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations) may also impact our business. The costs of
compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future. Any failure on our part to
comply with these laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and ef fort and
may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties.
Furthermore, many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and, as a
result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies. The laws that do reference
the internet are being interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and scope remain uncertain. For example, the laws
relating to the liability of providers of online services are currently unsettled both within the U.S. and abroad. Claims have
also been, or may be, threatened and filed against us under both U.S. and foreign laws for defamation, invasion of privacy
and other tort claims, unlawful activity , patent, copyright and trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature
and content of the materials searched and the ads posted by our users, our products and services, or content generated by
our users. Moreover , recent amendments to U.S. patent laws will become ef fective in 2012 and may af fect our ability to
protect our innovations and defend against claims of patent infringement.
In addition, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, our liability
for caching or hosting, or for listing or linking to, third-party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other
rights, so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act. Any future legislation impacting these safe harbors
may adversely impact us. V arious U.S. and international laws restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to
children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to
12

collect information from minors. In the area of data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users
when there is a security breach for personal data, such as Californias Information Practices Act. W e face similar risks and
costs as our products and services are of fered in international markets and may be subject to additional regulations.
We are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property or other claims, which are costly to defend, could result
in significant damage awards, and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.
Internet, technology , and media companies own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets
and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In
addition, patent holding companies may continue to seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained.
As we have grown, the intellectual property rights claims against us have increased and may continue to increase as we
develop new products, services, and technologies.
We have had patent, copyright, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our
products, services, and technologies, including Android, Google Search, Google AdW ords, Google AdSense, Google
Books, Google News, Google Image Search, Google Chrome, Google T alk, Google V oice, and Y ouTube, infringe the
intellectual property rights of others. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary
damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from of fering certain features, functionalities,
products, or services, and may also cause us to change our business practices, and require development of non-infringing
products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business.
In addition, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them for certain
intellectual property infringement claims against them, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims,
and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Furthermore, such
customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or
otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business.
Regardless of the merits of the claims, intellectual property claims are often time consuming, expensive to litigate or
settle, and cause significant diversion of management attention. T o the extent such intellectual property infringement claims
are successful, they may have an adverse ef fect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or
cash flows.
Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products,
services, and brand.
Our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us.
Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services
and technologies. For example, ef fective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our
products and services are distributed or made available through the internet. Also, the ef forts we have taken to protect our
proprietary rights may not be suf ficient or ef fective.
Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of
these innovations. Moreover , because of our long-term interests in open source, we may not have adequate patent
protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. Furthermore, there is always the possibility , despite our
efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insuf ficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or
unenforceable.
We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy could be compromised by outside
parties, or by our employees, which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets.
13

We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word Google could become
so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word search. If this happens, we could lose protection for this
trademark, which could result in other people using the word Google to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our
brand.
Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also,
protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our
intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.
We may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content.
We host and provide a wide variety of services and products that enable users to exchange information, advertise
products and services, conduct business, and engage in various online activities both domestically and internationally . The
law relating to the liability of providers of these online services and products for activities of their users is still somewhat
unsettled both within the U.S. and internationally . Claims have been threatened and have been brought against us for
defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, copyright or trademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity , tort,
including personal injury , fraud, or other theories based on the nature and content of information which we publish or to
which we provide links or that may be posted online or generated by us or by third parties, including our users. In addition,
we have been and may again in the future be subject to domestic or international actions alleging that certain content we
have generated or third-party content that we have made available within our services violates laws in domestic and
international jurisdictions.
We also arrange for the distribution of third-party advertisements to third-party publishers and advertising networks,
and we of fer third-party products, services, or content. W e may be subject to claims concerning these products, services, or
content by virtue of our involvement in marketing, branding, broadcasting, or providing access to them, even if we do not
ourselves host, operate, provide, or provide access to these products, services, or content. Defense of any such actions
could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources, may result in monetary
liabilities or penalties, and may require us to change our business in an adverse manner .
More people are using devices other than personal computers to access the internet. If users do not widely adopt
versions of our web search technology , products, or operating systems developed for these devices, our business could be
adversely affected.
The number of people who access the internet through devices other than personal computers, including mobile
phones, smart phones, handheld computers such as netbooks and tablets, video game consoles, and television set-top
devices, has increased dramatically in the past few years. The lower resolution, functionality , and memory associated with
some alternative devices make the use of our products and services through such devices more dif ficult and the versions of
our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users, manufacturers, or distributors of
alternative devices. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our
products and services may not work or be viewable on these devices as a result. W e have limited experience to date in
operating versions of our products and services developed or optimized for users of alternative devices, such as Google
Mobile and Android, or in designing alternative devices. As new devices and new platforms are continually being released,
it is dif ficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our products and services for use on these
alternative devices and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of such
devices. If we are unable to attract and retain a substantial number of alternative device manufacturers, distributors, and
users to our products and services, or if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are more compatible with
alternative devices, we will fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online
services, which could adversely af fect our business.

Privacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from
using our products and services.
From time to time, concerns have been expressed about whether our products and services compromise the privacy
of users and others. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal
information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and operating results. While
we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, any
failure or perceived failure to comply may result, and has resulted, in proceedings or actions against us by government
entities or others, or could cause us to lose users and customers, which could potentially have an adverse ef fect on our
business.
In addition, as nearly all of our products and services are web-based, the amount of data we store for our users on our
servers (including personal information) has been increasing. Any systems failure or compromise of our security that results
in the release of our users data could seriously limit the adoption of our products and services, as well as harm our
reputation and brand and, therefore, our business. W e expect to continue to expend significant resources to protect against
security breaches. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand
the number of web-based products and services we of fer, and operate in more countries.
Regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning
data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and
elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is
inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we
change our data practices, which could have an adverse ef fect on our business and results of operations. Complying with
these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner
adverse to our business.
If our security measures are breached, or if our services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to
access our products and services, our products and services may be perceived as not being secure, users and customers
may curtail or stop using our products and services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.
Our products and services involve the storage and transmission of users and customers proprietary information, and
security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation, and potential liability . Our security
measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error , malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a
result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data or our users or customers data. Additionally , outside parties
may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, users, or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access
to our data or our users or customers data. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and
financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that
could potentially have an adverse ef fect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access,
disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a
target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or
perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the ef fectiveness of our security measures could be
harmed and we could lose users and customers.
Web spam and content farms could decrease our search quality , which could damage our reputation and deter our
current and potential users from using our products and services.
Web spam refers to websites that attempt to violate a search engines quality guidelines or that otherwise seek to
rank higher in search results than a search engines assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Although
English-language web spam in our search results has been significantly reduced, and web spam in

most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek ways to improve their rankings
inappropriately . We continuously combat web spam, including through indexing technology that makes it harder for spam-
like, less useful web content to rank highly . We have also improved our ability to detect hacked websites, a major source of
web spam in 2010. W e face new challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites, including content farms,
which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve their search rankings. In 201 1,
we launched several algorithmic changes focused on low-quality websites. If web spam and content farms continue to
increase on Google, this could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce user traf fic to our websites.
In addition, as we continue to take actions to improve our search quality and reduce low-quality content, this may in the
short run reduce our AdSense revenues, since some of these websites are AdSense partners.
Interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively
provide our products and services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.
The availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and
communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, floods,
fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks, or other attempts to
harm our systems. Some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes. Our data centers
are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and to potential disruptions if the operators of
these facilities have financial dif ficulties. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning
cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster , a decision to close a facility we are using without
adequate notice for financial reasons, or other unanticipated problems at our data centers could result in lengthy
interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and may contain errors
or vulnerabilities. Any errors or vulnerabilities in our products and services, or damage to or failure of our systems, could
result in interruptions in our services, which could reduce our revenues and profits, and damage our brand.
Our business and operations are experiencing rapid growth. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business and
operating results could be harmed.
We have experienced rapid growth in our headcount and operations, which has placed, and will continue to place,
significant demands on our management, operational, and financial infrastructure. If we do not ef fectively manage our
growth, the quality of our products and services could suf fer, which could negatively af fect our brand and operating results.
Our expansion and growth in international markets heighten these risks as a result of the particular challenges of supporting
a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute
resolution systems, regulatory systems, and commercial infrastructures. T o effectively manage this growth, we will need to
continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, and our reporting systems and compliance
procedures. These systems enhancements and improvements will require significant capital expenditures and management
resources. Failure to implement these improvements could hurt our ability to manage our growth and our consolidated
financial position.
Our international operations expose us to additional risks which could harm our business, operating results, and financial
condition.
Our international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to further expand
internationally . International revenues accounted for approximately 54% of our total revenues in 201 1 and more than half of
our user traf fic has been coming from outside the U.S. In certain international markets, we have limited operating
experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. In addition to risks described
elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to additional risks, including the following:
Changes in local political, economic, social, and labor conditions, which may adversely harm our business.

Copyright © 2013 www .secdatabase.com . All Rights Reserved.
Please Consider the Environment Before Printing This DocumentTable of Contents
Restrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us
from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.
Import and export requirements that may prevent us from of fering products or providing services to a particular
market and may increase our operating costs.
Currency exchange rate fluctuations and our ability to manage these fluctuations through our foreign exchange risk
management program.
Longer payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud.
Uncertainty regarding liability for services and content, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of
legal precedent.
Different employee/employer relationships, existence of workers councils and labor unions, and other challenges
caused by distance, language, and cultural dif ferences, making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions.
In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations
increases our cost of doing business. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include internal
control and disclosure rules, data privacy and filtering requirements, anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental of ficials, and antitrust and competition
regulations, among others. V iolations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions
against us, our of ficers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to of fer our
products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially af fect our brand, our international expansion
efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results. Although we have implemented
policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that
our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.
Furthermore, since we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S.
dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Although we hedge a portion of our international
currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely
affect our net income. Additionally , hedging programs are inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could
adversely af fect our financial condition and results of operations.
If we were to lose the services of Larry , Sergey , Eric, or other key personnel, we may not be able to execute our business
strategy .
Our future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management
team. In particular , Larry Page and Sergey Brin are critical to the overall management of Google and the development of
our technology . Along with our Executive Chairman Eric E. Schmidt, they also play a key role in maintaining our culture and
setting our strategic direction. All of our executive of ficers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not
maintain any key-person life insurance policies. The loss of key personnel could seriously harm our business.
We rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or
maintain our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow effectively .
Our performance largely depends on the talents and ef forts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends
on our continuing ability to identify , hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our
organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly
targeted our employees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always
be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Our continued ability to
compete ef fectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.

In addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity , and teamwork. As our organization
grows, and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly
difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. This could negatively impact our future success.
Our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by us and our users. Internet access
providers may be able to block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to
additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.
Our products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet, and certain of our products require
significant bandwidth to work ef fectively . Currently , this access is provided by companies that have significant market power
in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile
communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers have taken, or have stated
that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by
restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our of ferings, or by charging increased fees to
us or our users to provide our of ferings. Such interference could result in a loss of existing users and advertisers, and
increased costs, and could impair our ability to attract new users and advertisers, thereby harming our revenues and
growth.
New technologies could block our ads, which would harm our business.
Technologies have been developed (including by us) that can block the display of our ads and that provide tools to
users to opt out of our advertising products. Most of our revenues are derived from fees paid to us by advertisers in
connection with the display of ads on web pages for our users. As a result, such technologies and tools could adversely
affect our operating results.
We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio.
Given the global nature of our business, we have investments both domestically and internationally . Credit ratings and
pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity , credit deterioration or losses, financial results, or other
factors. As a result, the value or liquidity of our cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a
material impairment, which could materially adversely af fect our financial condition and operating results.
We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.
Our future income taxes could be adversely af fected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have
lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the
valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program,
or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items. W e are subject to regular
review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a
negative ef fect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for
income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where
the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome
may dif fer from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially af fect our financial results in the period
or periods for which such determination is made.
Our operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of
expectations.
Our operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control. As a result,
comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely

on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Our quarterly , year-to-date, and annual expenses as a
percentage of our revenues may dif fer significantly from our historical or projected rates. Our operating results in future
quarters may fall below expectations. Any of these events could cause our stock price to fall. Each of the risk factors listed
in this section and the following factors may af fect our operating results:
Our ability to continue to attract users to our websites and satisfy existing users on our websites.
Our ability to monetize (or generate revenues from) traf fic on our websites and our Google Network Members
websites.
Our ability to attract advertisers to our AdW ords program, and our ability to attract websites to our AdSense
program.
The mix in our revenues between those generated on our websites and those generated through our Google
Network.
The amount of revenues and expenses generated and incurred in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and our
ability to manage the resulting risk through our foreign exchange risk management program.
The amount and timing of operating costs and expenses and capital expenditures related to the maintenance and
expansion of our businesses, operations, and infrastructure.
Our focus on long-term goals over short-term results.
The results of our investments in risky projects, including new business strategies and new products, services, and
technologies.
Our ability to keep our websites operational at a reasonable cost and without service interruptions.
Our ability to generate significant revenues from services in which we have invested considerable time and
resources, such as Google Checkout.
Because our business is changing and evolving, our historical operating results may not be useful to you in predicting
our future operating results. In addition, advertising spending has historically been cyclical in nature, reflecting overall
economic conditions, as well as budgeting and buying patterns. Also, user traf fic tends to be seasonal. Our rapid growth
has tended to mask the cyclicality and seasonality of our business. As our growth rate has slowed, the cyclicality and
seasonality in our business has become more pronounced and caused our operating results to fluctuate.
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock
The trading price for our Class A common stock may continue to be volatile.
The trading price of our Class A common stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue
to be volatile. For example, in 201 1, the price of our Class A common stock ranged from $473.02 per share to $646.76 per
share. The trading price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, some of which
are beyond our control. These factors include:
Quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors.
Announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new products, significant contracts, commercial
relationships, or capital commitments.
Recommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates.
Announcements about our earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations, the risk of which is enhanced
because it is our policy not to give guidance on earnings.
Announcements by our competitors of their earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations.

Commentary by industry and market professionals about our products, strategies, and other matters af fecting our
business and results, regardless of its accuracy .
The volume of shares of Class A common stock available for public sale.
Sales of stock by us or by our stockholders (including sales by our directors, executive of ficers, and other
employees).
Short sales, hedging, and other derivative transactions on shares of our Class A common stock (including
derivative transactions under our TSO program).
In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular , have experienced
extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of
those companies. These broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our Class A common stock,
regardless of our actual operating performance.
The concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders  ability to influence corporate matters.
Our Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of
December 31, 201 1, Larry , Sergey , and Eric beneficially owned approximately 92% of our outstanding Class B common
stock, representing approximately 66% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Larry , Sergey , and Eric
therefore have significant influence over management and af fairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval,
including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or
our assets, for the foreseeable future. This concentrated control limits our stockholders ability to influence corporate
matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial. As a result, the market price
of our Class A common stock could be adversely af fected.
Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may
consider favorable.
Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the ef fect of delaying or preventing a change of
control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:
Our certificate of incorporation provides for a dual class common stock structure. As a result of this structure, Larry ,
Sergey , and Eric have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of
directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets. This
concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger , takeover , or other change of
control transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial.
Our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of
directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director , which prevents stockholders from being able to fill
vacancies on our board of directors.
Our stockholders may not act by written consent. As a result, a holder , or holders, controlling a majority of our
capital stock would not be able to take certain actions without holding a stockholders meeting.
Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of
minority stockholders to elect director candidates.
Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to
propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a
potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirers own slate of directors or
otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company .
20

Our board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock. The ability
to issue undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with
voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.
As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law , a
corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting stock
unless the holder has held the stock for three years or , among other things, the board of directors has approved the
transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.

ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANAL YSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESUL TS OF
OPERA TIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with
our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
Google is a global technology leader focused on improving the ways people connect with information. Our innovations
in web search and advertising have made our website a top internet property and our brand one of the most recognized in
the world. Our mission is to organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful. W e serve three
primary constituencies:
Users. We provide users with products and services that enable people to more quickly and easily find, create, and
organize information that is useful to them.
Advertisers. We provide advertisers with cost-ef fective ways to deliver online and of fline ads to customers across
Google-owned websites and through the Google Network, which is the network of third parties that use our
advertising programs to deliver relevant ads with their search results and content.
Google Network Members and Other Content Providers. We provide members of our Google Network with our
Google AdSense programs. These include programs through which we distribute our advertisers AdW ords ads for
display on the websites of our Google Network Members. W e share most of the fees these ads generate with our
Google Network Members, thereby creating an important revenue stream for them. In addition, we have entered
into arrangements with other content providers under which we distribute or license their video and other content,
and we may display ads next to or as part of this content on the pages of our websites. W e share most of the fees
these ads generate with these content providers, thereby creating an important revenue stream for these partners.
Recent Development
On August 15, 201 1, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Motorola, a provider of innovative technologies,
products and services that enable a range of mobile and wireline digital communication, information and entertainment
experiences, under which we will acquire Motorola for $40 per share in cash, or a total of approximately $12.5 billion in
cash. The completion of this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain
regulatory approvals.
How W e Generate Revenue
Advertising revenues made up 97% of our revenues in 2009 and 96% of our revenues in 2010 and 201 1. We derive
most of our additional revenues from our enterprise products, as well as our display advertising management services to
advertisers, ad agencies, and publishers.
Google AdW ords is our auction-based advertising program that enables advertisers to place text-based and display
ads on our websites and our Google Network Members websites. Display advertising comprises the videos, text, images,
and other interactive ads that run across the web on computers and mobile devices, including smart phones and handheld
computers such as netbooks and tablets. Most of our AdW ords customers pay us on a cost-per-click basis, which means
that an advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on one of its ads. W e also of fer AdW ords on a cost-per-impression basis
that enables advertisers to pay us based on the number of times their ads appear on our websites and our Google Network
Members websites as specified by the advertisers. For advertisers using our AdW ords cost-per-click pricing, we recognize
as revenue the fees charged to advertisers
26

Please Consider the Environment Before Printing This DocumentTable of Contents
each time a user clicks on one of the ads that appears next to the search results or content on our websites or our Google
Network Members websites. For advertisers using our AdW ords cost-per-impression pricing, we recognize as revenue the
fees charged to advertisers each time their ads are displayed on our websites or our Google Network Members websites.
Our AdW ords agreements are generally terminable at any time by our advertisers.
Google AdSense refers to the online programs through which we distribute our advertisers AdW ords ads for display
on our Google Network Members websites, as well as programs to deliver ads on television broadcasts. Our AdSense
programs include AdSense for search and AdSense for content.
AdSense for search is our online service for distributing relevant ads from our advertisers for display with search
results on our Google Network Members websites. T o use AdSense for search, most of our AdSense for search partners
add Google search functionality to their web pages in the form of customizable Google search boxes. When visitors to
these websites search either the website or the internet using these customizable search boxes, we display relevant ads on
the search results pages, targeted to match user search queries. Ads shown through AdSense for search are text ads.
AdSense for content is our online service for distributing ads from our advertisers that are relevant to content on our
Google Network Members websites. Under this program, we use automated technology to analyze the meaning of the
content on the web page and serve relevant ads based on the meaning of such content. For example, a web page on an
automotive blog that contains an entry about vintage cars might display ads for vintage car parts or vintage car shows.
These ads are displayed in spaces that our AdSense for content partners have set aside on their websites. AdSense for
content allows a variety of ad types to be shown, including text ads, image ads, Google V ideo Ads, link units (which are
sets of clickable links to topic pages related to page content), themed units (which are regular text ads with graphic
treatments that change seasonally and by geography), and gadget ads (which are customized mini-sites that run as ads
on AdSense publisher websites).
For our online AdSense program, our advertisers pay us a fee each time a user clicks on one of our advertisers ads
displayed on our Google Network Members websites or , for those advertisers who choose our cost-per-impression pricing,
as their ads are displayed. T o date, we have paid most of these advertiser fees to our Google Network Members, and we
expect to continue doing so for the foreseeable future. W e recognize these advertiser fees as revenue and the portion of
the advertiser fee we pay to our Google Network Members as traf fic acquisition costs under cost of revenues. Google
Network Members do not pay any fees associated with the use of our AdSense program on their websites.
Our agreements with Google Network Members consist largely of uniform online click-wrap agreements that
members enter into by interacting with our registration websites. The standard agreements have no stated term and are
terminable at will. Agreements with our larger members are individually negotiated. Both the standard agreements and the
negotiated agreements require us to share with the Google Network Member most of the advertiser fees generated by
users clicking on ads on the Google Network Members website or , for advertisers who choose our cost-per-impression
pricing, as the ads are displayed on the Google Network Members website. For example, under our standard agreements,
we pay 51% and 68% of the fees collected from advertisers to our Google Network Members in AdSense for search and
AdSense for content, respectively .
We also of fer display advertising management services such as media planning, buying, implementation, and
measurement tools for advertisers and agencies, and forecasting and reporting tools for publishers. W e recognize the
related fees as other revenues in the period advertising impressions are delivered.
In January 2010, we launched, and in July 2010, we discontinued, our direct-to-consumer web store channel for
distributing our Nexus One mobile phone. W e had recognized fees derived from the sale of these phones as other
revenues in the period in which they were delivered.
We have entered into arrangements with certain content providers under which we distribute or license their video and
other content. Our agreements with content providers are typically standard agreements with no stated

term and are terminable at will. Agreements with our larger members are individually negotiated. Both the standard
agreements and the negotiated agreements require us to pay the content providers for the content we license. In a number
of these arrangements, we display ads on the pages of our websites from which the content is viewed and share most of
the fees these ads generate with the content providers. W e recognize these advertiser fees as revenue and the fees we
pay to our content providers as content acquisition costs under cost of revenues.
We believe the factors that influence the success of our advertising programs include the following:
The relevance, objectivity , and quality of our search results and the relevance and quality of ads displayed with

Trends in Our Business
Advertising transactions continue to shift from of fline to online as the digital economy evolves. This has contributed to
the rapid growth of our business since inception, resulting in substantially increased revenues, and we expect that our
business will continue to grow . However , our revenue growth rate has generally declined over time, and it could do so in the
future as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition, challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our
revenues increase to higher levels, and increasing maturity of the online advertising market and other markets in which we
participate. In addition, if there is a further general economic downturn, this may result in fewer commercial queries by our
users and may cause advertisers to reduce the amount they spend on online advertising, including the amount they are
willing to pay for each click or impression, which could negatively af fect the growth rate of our revenues. W e plan to
continue to invest aggressively in our core areas of strategic focus.
The main focus of our advertising programs is to provide relevant and useful advertising to our users, reflecting our
commitment to constantly improve their overall web experience. As a result, we expect to continue to take steps to improve
the relevance of the ads displayed on our websites and our Google Network Members websites. These steps include not
displaying ads that generate low click-through rates or that send users to irrelevant or otherwise low quality websites and
terminating our relationships with those Google Network Members whose websites do not meet our quality requirements.
We may also continue to take steps to reduce the number of accidental clicks by our users. These steps could negatively
affect the growth rate of our revenues.
Both seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality have af fected, and are likely to continue
to affect, our business. Internet usage generally slows during the summer months, and commercial

queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year . These seasonal trends have caused, and will likely
continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenues, as well as aggregate
paid click and average cost-per-click growth rates.
The operating margin we realize on revenues generated from ads placed on our Google Network Members websites
through our AdSense program is significantly lower than the operating margin we realize from revenues generated from ads
placed on our websites because most of the advertiser fees from ads served on Google Network Members websites are
shared with our Google Network Members. For the past five years, growth in advertising revenues from our websites has
generally exceeded that from our Google Network Members websites. This trend has had a positive impact on our
operating margins, and we expect that this will continue for the foreseeable future, although the relative rate of growth in
revenues from our websites compared to the rate of growth in revenues from our Google Network Members websites may
vary over time.
We also continue to invest aggressively in our systems, data centers, corporate facilities, information technology
infrastructure, and employees. W e increased our hiring in 201 1, and we may continue to do so and to provide competitive
compensation programs for our employees. For instance, ef fective January 1, 201 1, we increased base salaries for all of
our non-executive employees by 10% and shifted a portion of the bonus into base salary . Our full-time employee headcount
was 24,400 at December 31, 2010 and 32,467 at December 31, 201 1. Acquisitions will also remain an important
component of our strategy and use of capital, and we expect our current pace of acquisitions to continue. We expect our
cost of revenues will increase in dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods, primarily as a
result of forecasted increases in traf fic acquisition costs, data center costs, content acquisition costs, credit card and other
transaction fees, and other costs. In particular , traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues may
increase in the future if we are unable to continue to improve the monetization or generation of revenues from traf fic on our
websites and our Google Network Members websites.
As we expand our advertising programs and other products to international markets, we continue to increase our
exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates. W e have a foreign exchange risk management
program that is designed to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. However , this program
will not fully of fset the ef fect of fluctuations on our revenues and earnings.

The increase in our revenues from 2010 to 201 1 resulted primarily from an increase in advertising revenues generated
by Google websites and Google Network Members websites. The increase in advertising revenues for Google websites
and Google Network Members websites resulted primarily from an increase in the number of paid clicks through our
advertising programs and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. The increase
in the number of paid clicks generated through our advertising programs was due to an increase in aggregate traf fic, certain
monetization improvements including new ad formats, and the continued global expansion of our products, and our
advertiser and user base, as well as an increase in the number of Google Network Members. The increase in the average
cost-per-click paid by our advertisers was primarily driven by the increased spending from advertisers and a general
weakening of the U.S dollar compared to foreign currencies (primarily the Euro, Japanese yen, and British pound), partially
offset by the changes in geographical mix due to traf fic growth in emerging markets, where the average cost-per-click is
typically lower , compared to more mature markets. In addition, the increase in advertising revenues for Google Network
Members websites from 2010 to 201 1 was partially of fset by the loss of a search partnership and, to a lesser extent, by a
search quality improvement made during the first quarter of 201 1.
The increase in our revenues from 2009 to 2010 resulted primarily from an increase in advertising revenues generated
by Google websites and Google Network Members websites and, to a lesser extent, an increase in other revenues, largely
as a result of the launch of our mobile phone business in the first quarter of 2010. The increase in advertising revenue for
Google websites and Google Network Members websites from 2009 to 2010 resulted primarily from an increase in the
number of paid clicks through our advertising programs and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the average cost-per-click
paid by our advertisers. The increase in the number of paid clicks generated through our advertising programs was due to
an increase in aggregate traf fic, certain monetization improvements, including new ad formats, and the continued global
expansion of our products, and our advertiser and user base, as well as an increase in the number of Google Network

Improvements in our ability to ultimately monetize increased traf fic primarily relate to enhancing the end user
experience, including providing end users with ads that are more relevant to their search queries or to the content on the
Google Network Members websites they visit. For instance, these improvements include increasing site links to be full size
links with the URL (uniform resource locator), moving a portion of the first line of the ad to the heading to better promote the
content of the ad, providing an option to preview the ad, and moving the ads URL to a separate line below the heading for
greater page format consistency .
Aggregate paid clicks on Google websites and Google Network Members websites increased approximately 25%
from 2010 to 201 1 and approximately 16% from 2009 to 2010. A verage cost-per-click on Google websites and Google
Network Members websites increased approximately 3% from 2010 to 201 1 and 5% from 2009 to 2010. The rate of
change in aggregate paid clicks and average cost-per-click, and their correlation with the rate of change in revenues, has
fluctuated and may fluctuate in the future because of various factors, including the revenue growth rates on our websites
compared to those of our Google Network Members, advertiser competition for keywords, changes in foreign currency
exchange rates, seasonality , the fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs,
changes in advertising quality or formats, and general economic conditions. In addition, traf fic growth in emerging markets
compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels also contributes to these
fluctuations. Changes in aggregate paid clicks and average cost-per-click may not be indicative of our performance or
advertiser experiences in any specific geographic market, vertical, or industry .
We believe that the increase in the number of paid clicks on Google websites and Google Network Members
websites is substantially the result of our commitment to improving the relevance and quality of both our search results and
the advertisements displayed, which we believe results in a better user experience, which in turn results in more searches,
advertisers, and Google Network Members and other partners.
Revenues by Geography
The following table presents our domestic and international revenues as a percentage of consolidated revenues,
determined based on the billing addresses of our customers:
YearEnded December 31,

United States 47% 48% 46%
United Kingdom 13% 11% 11%
Rest of the world 40% 41% 43%
The growth in international revenues (other than the United Kingdom) as a percentage of consolidated revenues from
2010 to 201 1 resulted largely from increased acceptance of our advertising programs, our continued progress in developing
localized versions of our products for these international markets, and, to a lesser extent, a general weakening of the U.S
dollar compared to foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and Japanese yen).
The growth in international revenues (other than the United Kingdom) as a percentage of consolidated revenues from
2009 to 2010 resulted largely from increased acceptance of our advertising programs and our continued progress in
developing localized versions of our products for these international markets. The growth in revenues from the United
States as a percentage of consolidated revenues from 2009 to 2010 resulted largely from the recovery of certain key
verticals such as retail, travel, finance, and insurance. The decline in revenues from the United Kingdom as a percentage of
consolidated revenues from 2009 to 2010 resulted primarily from a less robust economic recovery relative to the United
States and the rest of the world, as well as a decrease in hedging gains recognized during 2010.
The general weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies (primarily the Euro, Japanese yen, and
British pound) from 2010 to 201 1 had a favorable impact on our international revenues. Had foreign

exchange rates remained constant in these periods, our revenues from the United Kingdom would have been $129 million,
or 3.2%, lower and our revenues from the rest of the world would have been approximately $834 million, or 5.1%, lower in
2011. This is before consideration of hedging gains of $9 million and $34 million recognized to revenues from the United
Kingdom and the rest of the world in 201 1.
The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies (primarily the Euro) from 2009 to
2010 had an unfavorable impact on our international revenues. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant in these
periods, our revenues from the United Kingdom would have been approximately $10 million, or 0.3% higher , and our
revenues from the rest of the world would have been approximately $25 million, or 0.2% higher in 2010. This is before
consideration of hedging gains of $42 million and $161 million recognized to revenues from the United Kingdom and the
rest of the world in 2010.
Although we expect to continue to make investments in international markets, these investments may not result in an
increase in our international revenues as a percentage of total revenues in 2012 or thereafter . See Note 16 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about
geographic areas.
Costs and Expenses
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues consists primarily of traf fic acquisition costs. T raffic acquisition costs consist of amounts ultimately
paid to our Google Network Members under AdSense arrangements and to certain other partners (our distribution partners)
who distribute our toolbar and other products (collectively referred to as access points) or otherwise direct search queries to
our website (collectively referred to as distribution arrangements). These amounts are primarily based on the revenue share
and fixed fee arrangements with our Google Network Members and distribution partners.
Certain distribution arrangements require us to pay our partners based on a fee per access point delivered and not
exclusivelyor at allbased on revenue share. These fees are non-refundable. Further , these arrangements are terminable
at will, although under the terms of certain contracts we or our distribution partners may be subject to penalties in the event
of early termination. W e recognize fees under these arrangements over the estimated useful lives of the access points
(approximately two years) to the extent we can reasonably estimate those lives and they are longer than one year , or based
on any contractual revenue share, if greater . Otherwise, the fees are charged to expense as incurred. The estimated useful
life of the access points is based on the historical average period of time they generate traf fic and revenues.
Cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the operation of our data centers, including depreciation,
labor , energy , and bandwidth costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions
including Google Checkout transactions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, as well as content acquisition costs.
We have entered into arrangements with certain content providers under which we distribute or license their video and
other content. In a number of these arrangements, we display ads on the pages of our websites from which the content is
viewed and share most of the fees these ads generate with the content providers. T o the extent we are obligated to make
guaranteed minimum revenue share payments to our content providers, we recognize as content acquisition costs the
contractual revenue share amount or on a straight-line basis, whichever is greater , over the terms of the agreements.

Total traf fic acquisition costs $6,169 $7,317 $8,811
Traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues 27.0 % 25.9 % 24.1 %
Cost of revenues increased $2,771 million from 2010 to 201 1. The increase was primarily related to an increase in
traffic acquisition costs of $1,132 million resulting from more advertiser fees generated through our AdSense program. The
increase was also related to an increase in traf fic acquisition costs of $362 million from our distribution arrangements as a
result of more traf fic directed to our websites, as well as more distribution fees paid. The decrease in traf fic acquisition costs
as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of advertising revenues from our
websites compared to our Google Network Members websites, more revenues realized from Google Network Members to
whom we pay less revenue share, and, to a lesser extent, expiration of an AdSense arrangement under which we paid
guaranteed minimum revenue share. In addition, there was an increase in data center costs of $784 million, primarily
resulting from the depreciation of additional information technology assets and data center buildings and an increase in
labor , energy , and bandwidth costs, and an increase in content acquisition costs of $236 million, primarily related to content
displayed on Y ouTube, partially of fset by a decrease in mobile phone costs.
Cost of revenues increased $1,573 million from 2009 to 2010. The increase was primarily related to an increase in
traffic acquisition costs of $897 million resulting largely from more advertiser fees generated through our AdSense program.
The increase was also related to an increase in traf fic acquisition costs of $251 million from our distribution arrangements
as a result of more traf fic directed to our websites, as well as more distribution fees paid. The decrease in traf fic acquisition
costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily due to more revenues realized from Google Network Members
to whom we pay less revenue share, and expiration of an AdSense arrangement under which we paid guaranteed minimum
revenue share. In addition, there was an increase in content acquisition costs of $169 million primarily related to content
displayed on Y ouTube and an increase in mobile phone costs.
We expect cost of revenues will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of revenues in 2012 and
in future periods, primarily as a result of forecasted increases in traf fic acquisition costs, data center costs, credit card and
other transaction fees, content acquisition costs, and other costs. T raffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising
revenues may fluctuate in the future based on a number of factors, including the following:
The relative growth rates of revenues from our websites and from our Google Network Members websites.
Whether we are able to enter into more AdSense arrangements that provide for lower revenue share obligations or
whether increased competition for arrangements with existing and potential Google Network Members results in
less favorable revenue share arrangements.
Whether we are able to continue to improve the monetization of traf fic on our websites and our Google Network
Members websites.

The relative growth rates of expenses associated with distribution arrangements and the related revenues
generated, including whether we share with certain existing and new distribution partners proportionately more of
the aggregate advertising fees that we earn from paid clicks derived from search queries these partners direct to
our websites.
Research and Development
The following table presents our research and development expenses, and research and development expenses as a
percentage of our revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions):
Year Ended December 31,
2009 2010 2011
Research and development expenses $2,843 $3,762 $5,162
Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues 12.0 % 12.8 % 13.6 %
Research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel responsible
for the research and development of new and existing products and services. W e expense research and development costs
as they are incurred.
Research and development expenses increased $1,400 million from 2010 to 201 1. This increase was primarily due to
an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $875 million, largely as a result of a 23% increase in research and
development headcount, including headcount from acquisitions, as well as an increase in employee base salaries of
approximately 10%. In addition, there was an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $200 million.
Research and development expenses increased $919 million from 2009 to 2010. This increase was primarily due to an
increase in labor-related costs of $578 million, largely as a result of a 28% increase in research and development
headcount, including headcount from acquisitions. In addition, there was an increase in stock-based compensation
expense of $136 million.
We expect that research and development expenses will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage
of revenues in 2012 and future periods because we expect to continue to invest in building the necessary employee and
systems infrastructures required to support the development of new , and improve existing, products and services.
Sales and Marketing
The following table presents our sales and marketing expenses, and sales and marketing expenses as a percentage
of revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions):
Year Ended December 31,

Sales and marketing expenses $1,984 $2,799 $4,589
Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues 8.4 % 9.5 % 12.1 %
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel engaged in customer
service, sales, and sales support functions, as well as advertising and promotional expenditures.
Sales and marketing expenses increased $1,790 million from 2010 to 201 1. This increase was primarily due to an
increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $787 million, largely as a result of a 36% increase in sales and marketing
headcount, including headcount from acquisitions, as well as an increase in employee base salaries of approximately 10%.
In addition, there was an increase in advertising and promotional expense of $700 million.

Sales and marketing expenses increased $815 million from 2009 to 2010. This increase was primarily due to an
increase in advertising and promotional expense of $387 million. In addition, there was an increase in labor-related costs of
$254 million, largely as a result of a 20% increase in sales and marketing headcount, and higher commission expense.
We expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of
revenues in 2012 and future periods, as we expand our business globally , increase advertising and promotional
expenditures in connection with new and existing products, and increase the level of service we provide to our advertisers,
Google Network Members, and other partners.
General and Administrative
The following table presents our general and administrative expenses, and general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions):
Year Ended December 31,

General and administrative expenses $1,668 $1,962 $2,724
General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues 7.0 % 6.8 % 7.2 %
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel and facilities,
and include costs related to our facilities, finance, human resources, information technology , and legal organizations, and
fees for professional services. Professional services are principally comprised of outside legal, audit, information technology
consulting, and outsourcing services.
General and administrative expenses increased $762 million from 2010 to 201 1. This increase was primarily due to an
increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $350 million, primarily as a result of a 37% increase in general and
administrative headcount and an increase in employee base salaries of approximately 10%, as well as an increase in
expense related to professional services of $260 million, the majority of which were related to consulting services and legal
costs. In addition, there was an increase in stock-based compensation of $1 16 million.
General and administrative expenses increased $294 million from 2009 to 2010. This increase was primarily due to
increases in expense related to professional services of $137 million, the majority of which were related to legal and
temporary services costs. In addition, there was an increase in labor-related costs of $64 million largely as a result of a 14%
increase in general and administrative headcount, and an increase in charitable contributions of $64 million.
As we expand our business and incur additional expenses, we expect general and administrative expenses will
increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of revenues in 2012 and future periods.
Charge Related to the Resolution of Department of Justice Investigation
In connection with a resolution of an investigation by the United States Department of Justice into the use of Google
advertising by certain advertisers, we accrued $500 million during the three months ended March 31, 201 1, which was paid
in August 201 1 upon final resolution of that matter .
Stock-Based Compensation

Stock-based compensation increased $598 million from 2010 to 201 1. This increase was largely due to additional
stock awards issued to existing and new employees.
Stock-based compensation increased $212 million from 2009 to 2010. This increase was largely due to additional
stock awards issued to existing and new employees.
We estimate stock-based compensation to be approximately $2.0 billion in 2012 and $2.4 billion thereafter . This
estimate does not include expenses to be recognized related to employee stock awards that are granted after
December 31, 201 1 or non-employee stock awards that have been or may be granted. In addition, to the extent forfeiture
rates are dif ferent from what we have anticipated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be dif ferent from
our expectations.
Interest and Other Income, Net
Interest and other income, net increased $169 million from 2010 to 201 1. This increase was primarily driven by an
increase in interest income of $233 million due to an increase in our cash and investment balances and higher yields, as
well as an increase in net realized gains on sales of available-for-sale investments of $69 million, partially of fset by an
increase in interest expense of $53 million primarily related to our long-term debt program. In addition, we recorded an
impairment charge of $1 10 million related to certain equity investments during the year ended December 31, 201 1.
Interest and other income, net increased $346 million from 2009 to 2010. This increase was primarily driven by an
increase in interest income of $349 million due to an increase in our cash and investment balances and higher yields, as
well as an increase in net realized gains on sales of available-for-sale investments of $88 million. These increases were
partially of fset by an increase in net foreign exchange related costs of $95 million primarily related to our foreign exchange
risk management program.
The costs of our foreign exchange hedging activities that we recognized to interest and other income, net are primarily
a function of the notional amount of the option and forward contracts and their related duration, the movement of the foreign
exchange rates relative to the strike prices of the contracts, as well as the volatility of the foreign exchange rates.
As we expand our international business, we believe costs related to hedging activities under our foreign exchange
risk management program may increase in dollar amount in 2012 and future periods.
Provision for Income T axes
The following table presents our provision for income taxes, and ef fective tax rate for the periods presented (dollars in
millions):
Year Ended December 31,
2009 2010 2011
Provision for income taxes $1,861 $2,291 $2,589
Effective tax rate 22.2 % 21.2 % 21.0 %
Our provision for income taxes increased from 2010 to 201 1, primarily as a result of increases in federal income taxes,
driven by higher taxable income year over year , partially of fset by proportionately more earnings realized in countries that
have lower statutory tax rates. Our ef fective tax rate decreased from 2010 to 201 1, primarily as a result of proportionately
more earnings realized in countries that have lower statutory tax rates, a decrease in state income taxes, and an increase
in federal research and development credits recognized in 201 1, partially of fset by recognition of a charge related to the
resolution of an investigation by the Department of Justice which is not deductible for tax purposes.

Our provision for income taxes increased from 2009 to 2010, primarily as a result of increases in federal and state
income taxes, driven by higher taxable income year over year .Our ef fective tax rate decreased from 2009 to 2010, primarily
because we released certain tax reserves as a result of the settlement of our 2005 and 2006 tax audits in 2010. This
decrease was partially of fset by proportionately higher earnings in countries where we have higher statutory tax rates.
Our ef fective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely af fected to the extent
earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that
have higher statutory rates. Our ef fective tax rate could also fluctuate due to the net gains and losses recognized by legal
entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk
management program, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes in tax laws,
regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items. In addition, we are subject to the continuous
examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. W e regularly assess
the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for
income taxes.
See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below for additional information about our provision for income taxes.
A reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to our ef fective tax rate is set forth in Note 15 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

You should read the following tables presenting our quarterly results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. W e have prepared the
unaudited information on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements. Y ou should also keep in mind
that our operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future quarters or for a full year .

The following table presents our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the eight quarters ended December 31,
2011. This table includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that we consider necessary for
fair presentation of our consolidated financial position and operating results for the quarters presented. Both seasonal
fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality have af fected, and are likely to continue to af fect, our
business. Internet usage generally slows during the summer months, and commercial queries typically increase significantly
in the fourth quarter of each year . These seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our
quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
In summary , our cash flows are as follows (in millions):
Year Ended December 31,
2009 2010 2011
Net cash provided by operating activities $9,316 $11,081 $14,565
Net cash used in investing activities (8,019 ) (10,680 ) (19,041 )
Net cash provided by financing activities 233 3,050 807
At December 31, 201 1, we had $44.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents
and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market and other funds, including cash collateral received
related to our securities lending program, highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, debt
instruments issued by foreign governments, and municipalities in the U.S., corporate securities, and mortgage-backed
securities.
As of December 31, 201 1, $21.2 billion of the $44.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities was
held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue
and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. However , our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S.
and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations.
Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow
that we generate from our operations. At December 31, 201 1, we had unused letters of credit for approximately $46 million.
We believe that our sources of funding will be suf ficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at
least the next 12 months. Our liquidity could be negatively af fected by a decrease in demand for our products and services.
In addition, we may make acquisitions or license products and technologies complementary to our business and may need

Please Consider the Environment Before Printing This Documentto raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to provide for greater flexibility to fund any such
acquisitions and licensing activities. Additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us.

We have a debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper . Net proceeds from
this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 201 1, we had $750 million of commercial paper
outstanding recorded as short-term debt, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.1%. A verage commercial paper
borrowings during the year were $1.4 billion and the maximum amount outstanding during the year was $3.0 billion. In
conjunction with this program, we have a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in July 2016. The interest rate for the
credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. As of December 31, 201 1, we were in
compliance with the financial covenant in the credit facility . No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of
December 31, 201 1.
Additionally , as of December 31, 201 1, we had a $468 million secured promissory note outstanding recorded as short-
term debt, with an interest rate of 1.0% that matures in December 2012.
In May 201 1, we issued $3.0 billion of unsecured senior notes in three equal tranches, due in 2014, 2016, and 2021,
with stated interest rates of 1.25%, 2.125%, and 3.625%. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to repay a
portion of our outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 201 1, the total
carrying value and estimated fair value of these notes were $3.0 billion and $3.2 billion. The estimated fair value was based
on quoted prices for our publicly-traded debt as of December 31, 201 1. We are not subject to any financial covenants under
the notes. During 201 1, we paid $35 million in interest payments related to these notes.
In August 201 1, we entered into a Merger Agreement with Motorola, a provider of innovative technologies, products
and services that enable a range of mobile and wireline digital communication, information and entertainment experiences,
under which we will acquire Motorola for $40 per share in cash, or a total of approximately $12.5 billion. The completion of
this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. In the event
the Merger Agreement is terminated due to a failure to obtain certain regulatory approvals, we would be required to pay
Motorola a feeof $2.5 billion. The transaction is currently expected to close in early 2012.
Cash provided by operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including amortization,
depreciation, deferred income taxes, excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities, stock-based compensation
expense, and impairment of equity investments, as well as the ef fect of changes in working capital and other activities.
Cash provided by operating activities in 201 1 was $14,565 million and consisted of net income of $9,737 million,
adjustments for non-cash items of $4,198 million, and cash provided by working capital and other activities of $630 million.
Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $1,974 million of stock-based compensation expense, $1,396 million
of depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment, $455 million of amortization of intangible and other
assets, $343 million of deferred income taxes, and $1 10 million related to impairment of equity investments. In addition, the
increase in cash from changes in working capital activities primarily consisted of an increase in accrued expenses and other
liabilities of $795 million, a net increase in income taxes payable and deferred income taxes of $731 million, an increase in
accrued revenue share of $259 million, an increase of $162 million in deferred revenue, and an increase of $101 million in
accounts payable. These increases were partially of fset by an increase in accounts receivable of $1,156 million due to the
growth in fees billed to our advertisers, and an increase in prepaid revenue share, expenses and other assets of $262
million. The increase in income taxes payable and deferred income taxes reflected primarily additional tax obligations
accrued, partially of fset by estimated income taxes paid during 201 1. In addition, we paid $500 million related to the
resolution of a Department of Justice investigation during the year .
Cash provided by operating activities in 2010 was $1 1,081 million, and consisted of net income of $8,505 million,
adjustments for non-cash items of $2,675 million, and cash used in working capital and other activities of $99 million.
Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $1,376 million of stock-based compensation expense, $1,067 million
of depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment, and $329 million of amortization of intangible and
other assets, partially of fset by $94 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based

award activities. In addition, the decrease in cash from changes in working capital activities primarily consisted of an
increase of $1,129 million in accounts receivable due to the growth in fees billed to our advertisers and an increase of $414
million in prepaid revenue share, expenses and other assets. These increases were partially of fset by an increase in
accrued expenses and other liabilities of $745 million, an increase in accounts payable of $272 million, an increase in
accrued revenue share of $214 million, an increase in deferred revenue of $1 11 million, and a net increase in income tax
payable and deferred income taxes of $102 million, which includes the same $94 million of excess tax benefits from stock-
based award activities included under adjustments for non-cash items. The increase in accrued expense and other
liabilities, accounts payable, accrued revenue share, and deferred revenues are primarily a result of the growth in our
business and headcount. The increase in net income taxes payable and deferred income taxes was primarily a result of
additional tax obligations accrued, partially of fset by the release of certain tax reserves as a result of the settlement of our
tax audits for our 2005 and 2006 tax years.
Cash provided by operating activities in 2009 was $9,316 million, and consisted of net income of $6,520 million,
adjustments for non-cash items of $2,310 million, and cash provided by working capital and other activities of $486 million.
Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $1,240 million of depreciation and amortization expense on property
and equipment, $1,164 million of stock-based compensation expense, and $284 million of amortization of intangible and
other assets, partially of fset by $268 million of deferred income taxes on earnings and $90 million of excess tax benefits
from stock-based award activities. In addition, changes in working capital activities primarily consisted of a decrease of
$262 million in prepaid revenue share, expenses, and other assets, an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of
$243 million which is a direct result of the growth of our business, and a net increase in income taxes payable and deferred
income taxes of $217 million, which includes the same $90 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities
included under adjustments for non-cash items, and an increase in accrued revenue share of $158 million. These increases
were partially of fset by an increase of $504 million in accounts receivable due to the growth in fees billed to our advertisers.
The increase in net income taxes payable and deferred income taxes was primarily a result of additional tax obligations
accrued, partially of fset by an increase in the amount of estimated income taxes we paid during the year . The increase in
accrued revenue share was due to the growth in our AdSense and distribution programs and the timing of payments made
to our partners.
As we expand our business internationally , we have of fered payment terms to certain advertisers that are standard in
their locales but longer than terms we would generally of fer to our domestic advertisers. This may increase our working
capital requirements and may have a negative ef fect on cash provided by our operating activities.
Cash used in investing activities in 201 1 of $19,041 million was primarily attributable to net purchases of marketable
securities of $12,926 million, capital expenditures of $3,438 million related principally to our facilities, data centers, and
related equipment, and cash consideration used in acquisitions and other investments of $2,328 million, including $676
million paid in connection with the acquisition of IT A. Also, in connection with our securities lending program, we returned
$354 million of cash collateral. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K for further information about our securities lending program.
Cash used in investing activities in 2010 of $10,680 million was primarily attributable to net purchases of marketable
securities of $6,886 million, capital expenditures of $4,018 million of which $1.8 billion was for the purchase of an of fice
building in New Y ork City in December 2010, and remaining amounts related principally to our data centers and related
equipment, and cash consideration used in acquisitions and other investments of $1,067 million. Also, in connection with
our securities lending program, we received $2,361 million of cash collateral which was invested in reverse repurchase
agreements. Of the $2,361 million, $1,61 1 million was classified as cash and cash equivalents, and $750 million was
classified as receivable under reverse repurchase agreements in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Cash used in investing activities in 2009 of $8,019 million was primarily attributable to net purchases of marketable
securities of $7,036 million and capital expenditures of $810 million.

In order to manage expected increases in internet traf fic, advertising transactions, and new products and services, and
to support our overall global business expansion, we expect to make significant investments in our systems, data centers,
corporate facilities, information technology infrastructure, and employees in 2012 and thereafter . However , the amount of
our capital expenditures has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis.
In addition, we expect to spend a significant amount of cash on acquisitions and other investments from time to time.
These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, our
technologies, and our product of ferings.
Cash provided by financing activities in 201 1 of $807 million was primarily driven by net proceeds of $726 million of
debt issued and excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities of $86 million.
Cash provided by financing activities in 2010 of $3,050 million was primarily driven by $3,463 million of net cash
proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and a promissory note. This was partially of fset by $801 million in stock
repurchases in connection with our acquisitions of AdMob and On2 T echnologies, Inc., as well as net proceeds from stock-
based award activities of $294 million, and excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities of $94 million.
Cash provided by financing activities in 2009 of $233 million was primarily due to net proceeds related to stock-based
award activities of $143 million. In addition, there were excess tax benefits of $90 million from stock-based award activities
during the period which represented a portion of the $260 million reduction to income taxes payable that we recorded in
2009 related to the total direct tax benefit realized from the exercise, sale, or vesting of these awards.

Operating Leases
We have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our of fices, land, and data
centers throughout the world with original lease periods expiring primarily between 2012 and 2063. W e are committed to
pay a portion of the related operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements. These operating expenses are
not included in the above table. Certain of these leases have free or escalating rent payment provisions. W e recognize rent
expense under such leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases have adjustments for market
provisions.

Please Consider the Environment Before Printing This DocumentTable of Contents
Purchase Obligations
Purchase obligations represent non-cancelable contractual obligations at December 31, 201 1. These contracts are
primarily related to distribution arrangements, video and other content licensing revenue sharing arrangements, as well as
data center operations and facility build-outs. In addition, we had $2.8 billion of open purchase orders for which we have not
received the related services or goods at December 31, 201 1. This amount is not included in the above table because we
have the right to cancel the purchase orders prior to the date of delivery .
Long-term Debt Obligations
Long-term debt obligations represent principal and interest payments to be made over the life of our unsecured senior
notes issued in May 201 1. Please see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.
Other Long-T erm Liabilities
Other long-term liabilities consist of cash obligations, primarily the legal settlement with the Authors Guild and the
Association of American Publishers (AAP), and milestone and royalty payments owed in connection with certain
acquisitions and licensing agreements.
In addition to the amounts above, we recorded additional long-term taxes payable of $438 million in 201 1 related to tax
positions for which the timing of the ultimate resolution is uncertain. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably
reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax
audit outcomes. As a result, this amount is not included in the above table.
Off-Balance Sheet Entities
At December 31, 201 1, we did not have any of f-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of
Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future ef fect on our financial
condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity , capital expenditures, or
capital resources that is material to investors.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
U.S. (U.S. GAAP). In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that af fect our reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. In some cases, we
could reasonably have used dif ferent accounting policies and estimates. In some cases, changes in the accounting
estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly , actual results could dif fer materially from our
estimates. T o the extent that there are material dif ferences between these estimates and actual results, our financial
condition or results of operations will be af fected. W e base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that
we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. W e refer to
accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below . We have
reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.
Income T axes
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in
evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.
43
Copyright © 2013 www .secdatabase.com . All Rights Reserved.
Please Consider the Environment Before Printing This DocumentTable of Contents
Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the
final tax outcome of these matters will not be dif ferent. W e adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and
circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. T o the extent that the final tax outcome of
these matters is dif ferent than the amounts recorded, such dif ferences will impact the provision for income taxes in the
period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and
changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest.
Our ef fective tax rates have dif fered from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign operations, state
taxes, certain benefits realized related to stock-based award activities, and research and experimentation tax credits. The
effective tax rates were 22.2%, 21.2%, and 21.0% for 2009, 2010, and 201 1. Our future ef fective tax rates could be
adversely af fected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than
anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates, the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain
hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program,
changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting
principles, as well as certain discrete items. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax
returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. W e regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these
examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
Loss Contingencies
We are regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition and
antitrust, intellectual property , privacy , tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users,
goods and services of fered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. Certain of these matters
include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. W e record a liability when we believe that
it is both probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. W e evaluate, on a monthly
basis, developments in our legal matters that could af fect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and
make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the
estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to
loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions
change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our business, consolidated financial position,
results of operations, or cash flows. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding contingencies.
Stock-Based Compensation
Our stock-based compensation expense for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on the awards fair
value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the
requisite service period. The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and
expected term. If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model changes significantly , stock-based compensation expense
may dif fer materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. In addition, we are required to estimate the
expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. W e estimate the forfeiture rate
based on historical experience and our expectations regarding future pre-vesting termination behavior of employees. T o the
extent our actual forfeiture rate is dif ferent from our estimate, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly .
Impairment of Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities
We periodically review our marketable securities and our non-marketable equity securities for impairment. If we
conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary .
Factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment,

the reason for the decline in value, the potential recovery period, and our intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not
that we will be required to sell, the investment before recovery . If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary , we
will write down the asset to its fair value and take a corresponding charge to our Consolidated Statements of Income.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 201 1, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (F ASB) issued an amendment to an existing accounting
standard which requires companies to present net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or
in two separate, but consecutive, statements. In addition, in December 201 1, the F ASB issued an amendment to an existing
accounting standard which defers the requirement to present components of reclassifications of other comprehensive
income on the face of the income statement. We adopted both standards in the fourth quarter of 201 1.
In September 201 1, the F ASB issued an amendment to an existing accounting standard, which provides entities an
option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing on goodwill is necessary .
Specifically , an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the
current two-step test. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair
value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further
testing is required. This standard is ef fective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 201 1.We adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2012 and the adoption will not have a
material impact on our financial statements.
In May 201 1, the F ASB issued a new accounting standard update, which amends the fair value measurement
guidance and includes some enhanced disclosure requirements. The most significant change in disclosures is an
expansion of the information required for Level 3 measurements based on unobservable inputs. The standard is ef fective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 201 1.We adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2012 and the adoption
will not have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures.
ITEM 7A.QUANTIT ATIVE AND QUALIT ATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Economic Exposure
We transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues, as well as costs
denominated in foreign currencies. This exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. W e
purchase foreign exchange option contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows related to forecasted revenues
denominated in certain foreign currencies. The objective of the foreign exchange contracts is to better ensure that the U.S.
dollar-equivalent cash flows are not adversely af fected by changes in the U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rates.
These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. The gain on the ef fective portion of a cash flow hedge is initially
reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassified into revenues
when the hedged revenues are recorded or as interest and other income, net, if the hedged transaction becomes probable
of not occurring. Any gain after a hedge is de-designated or related to an inef fective portion of a hedge is recognized as
interest and other income, net, immediately .
At December 31, 2010, the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with
Euros were 3.0 billion (or approximately $4.1 billion) and $227 million; the notional principal and fair value of foreign
exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with British pounds were £1.5 billion (or approximately $2.3 billion) and $97
million; and the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Canadian
dollars were C$407 million (or approximately $382 million) and $6 million. At

December 31, 201 1, the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Euros
were 2.8 billion (or approximately $3.8 billion) and $232 million; the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange
contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with British pounds were £1.4 billion (or approximately $2.2 billion) and $80 million; and
the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Canadian dollars were
C$504 million (or approximately $490 million) and $17 million. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities of 36
months or less. W e may enter into similar contracts in other foreign currencies in the future.
We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that
changes in exchange rates of 20% for our foreign currencies instruments could be experienced in the near term.
If the U.S. dollar weakened by 20%, the amount recorded in AOCI before tax ef fect would have been approximately
$140 million and $132 million lower at December 31, 2010 and 201 1, and the total amount of expense recorded as interest
and other income, net, would have been approximately $134 million and $138 million higher in the years ended
December 31, 2010 and 201 1. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 20%, the amount recorded in accumulated AOCI before
tax ef fect would have been approximately $1.2 billion higher at both December 31, 2010 and 201 1, and the total amount of
expense recorded as interest and other income, net, would have been approximately $175 million and $202 million higher
in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 201 1.
Transaction Exposure
Our exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses is the result of certain net receivables due from our
foreign subsidiaries and customers being denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary ,
primarily the Euro and the British pound. Our foreign subsidiaries conduct their businesses in local currency . We have
entered into foreign exchange contracts to of fset the foreign exchange risk on certain monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the subsidiary .
The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with foreign currencies was $1.0 billion
and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2010 and 201 1. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to sell U.S. dollars for
foreign currencies was $84 million and $472 million at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 201 1. The notional principal
of foreign exchange contracts to purchase Euros with other foreign currencies was 991million (or approximately $1.3
billion) and 711million (or approximately $929 million) at December 31, 2010 and 201 1. The notional principal of foreign
exchange contracts to sell Euros for other foreign currencies was 6million (or approximately $8 million) at December 31,
2010 and no such contracts were outstanding at December 31, 201 1.
We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that
adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. These changes would
have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $20 million and $27 million at
December 31, 2010 and 201 1. The adverse impact at December 31, 2010 and 201 1 is after consideration of the of fsetting
effect of approximately $467 million and $503 million from foreign exchange contracts in place for the months of December
2010 and December 201 1. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% were applied to total
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currencies at the balance sheet dates to
compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term.
Interest Rate Risk
We invest our excess cash primarily in highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies,
municipalities in the U.S., debt instruments issued by foreign governments, time deposits, money market and other funds,
mortgage-backed securities, and corporate debt securities. By policy , we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one
issuer .

Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate
securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities
may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our income from investments may
decrease in the future. However , we use certain interest rate derivative contracts to hedge interest rate risk of our fixed
income securities.
We considered the historical volatility of short-term interest rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that
an adverse change of 100 basis points could be experienced in the near term. A hypothetical 1.00% (100 basis points)
increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our marketable securities of approximately
$895 million and $934 million at December 31, 2010 and 201 1, after taking into consideration the of fsetting ef fect from
interest rate derivative contracts outstanding as of December 31, 201 1.

REPOR T OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Google Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Google Inc. as of December 31, 2010 and 201 1,
and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity , and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 201 1. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed
in the Index at Item 15(a)2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. W e
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly , in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Google Inc. at December 31, 2010 and 201 1, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 201 1, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States), Google Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 201 1, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the T readway Commission
and our report dated January 26, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPOR T OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Google Inc.
We have audited Google Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 201 1, based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Google Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining ef fective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the ef fectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating ef fectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. W e believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material ef fect on the financial
statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of ef fectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
In our opinion, Google Inc. maintained, in all material respects, ef fective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 201 1, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States), the consolidated balance sheets of Google Inc. as of December 31, 2010 and 201 1, and the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity , and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 201 1 of Google Inc. and our report dated January 26, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

NOTES T O CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL ST ATEMENTS
Note 1.Google Inc. and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Nature of Operations
We were incorporated in California in September 1998. W e were re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August
2003. W e generate revenues primarily by delivering relevant, cost-ef fective online advertising.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Google Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that af fect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial
statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could dif fer materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis,
we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the accounts receivable and sales allowances, fair values of financial
instruments, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, fair values of
stock-based awards, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among others. W e base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
Revenue Recognition
The following table presents our revenues by revenue source (in millions):
Year Ended December 31,
2009 2010 2011
Advertising revenues:
Google websites $15,723 $19,444 $26,145
Google Network Members websites 7,166 8,792 10,386
Total advertising revenues 22,889 28,236 36,531
Other revenues 762 1,085 1,374
Revenues $23,651 $29,321 $37,905
Google AdW ords is our auction-based advertising program that enables advertisers to place text-based and display
ads on our websites and our Google Network Members websites. Display advertising comprises the videos, text, images,
and other interactive ads that run across the web on computers and mobile devices, including smart phones and handheld
computers such as netbooks and tablets. Most of our AdW ords customers pay us on a cost-per-click basis, which means
that an advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on one of its ads. W e also of fer AdW ords on a cost-per-impression basis
that enables advertisers to pay us based on the number of times their ads appear on our websites and our Google Network
Members websites as specified by the advertisers.
Google AdSense refers to the online programs through which we distribute our advertisers AdW ords ads for display
on our Google Network Members websites, as well as programs to deliver ads on television broadcasts.

We recognize as revenues the fees charged to advertisers each time a user clicks on one of the ads that appears next
to the search results or content on our websites or our Google Network Members websites. For those advertisers using
our AdW ords cost-per-impression pricing, we recognize as revenues the fees charged to advertisers each time their ads
are displayed on our websites or our Google Network Members websites. W e report our Google AdSense revenues on a
gross basis principally because we are the primary obligor to our advertisers.
We recognize revenues when the services or products have been provided or delivered, the fees we charge are fixed
or determinable, we and our advertisers or other customers understand the specific nature and terms of the agreed upon
transactions, and collectability is reasonably assured.
We record deferred revenue upon invoicing or when cash payments are received in advance of our performance in the
underlying agreement on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues consists primarily of traf fic acquisition costs. T raffic acquisition costs consist of amounts ultimately
paid to our Google Network members under AdSense arrangements and to certain other partners (our distribution partners)
who distribute our toolbar and other products (collectively referred to as access points) or otherwise direct search queries to
our website (collectively referred to as distribution arrangements). These amounts are primarily based on the revenue share
and fixed fee arrangements with our Google Network Members and distribution partners.
Certain distribution arrangements require us to pay our partners based on a fee per access point delivered and not
exclusivelyor at allbased on revenue share. These fees are non-refundable. Further , these arrangements are terminable
at will, although under the terms of certain contracts we or our distribution partners may be subject to penalties in the event
of early termination. W e recognize fees under these arrangements over the estimated useful lives of the access points
(approximately two years) to the extent we can reasonably estimate those lives and they are longer than one year , or based
on any contractual revenue share, if greater . Otherwise, the fees are charged to expense as incurred. The estimated useful
life of the access points is based on the historical average period of time they generate traf fic and revenues. Further , we
review the access points for impairment by distribution partner , type, and geography , and we have not made any
impairment to date.
Prepaid revenue share and distribution fees are included in prepaid revenue share, expenses, and other assets on the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the operation of our data centers, including depreciation,
labor , energy , and bandwidth costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions
including Google Checkout transactions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, as well as content acquisition costs.
We have entered into arrangements with certain content providers under which we distribute or license their video and
other content. In a number of these arrangements, we display ads on the pages of our web sites from which the content is
viewed and share most of the fees these ads generate with the content providers. T o the extent we are obligated to make
guaranteed minimum revenue share payments to our content providers, we recognize as content acquisition costs the
contractual revenue share amount or on a straight-line basis, whichever is greater , over the terms of the agreements.
Stock-based Compensation
We have elected to use the BSM option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options on the dates of
grant .Restricted stock units (RSUs) are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of
grant. Shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements to be paid by us
on behalf of our employees. As a result, the actual number of shares issued will be fewer than the actual number of RSUs
outstanding. Furthermore, we record the liability for withholding amounts to be paid by us as a reduction to additional paid-
in capital when paid. Also, we recognize stock-based compensation using the straight-line method.

We include as part of cash flows from financing activities the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the tax-ef fected
compensation of the related stock-based awards for options exercised and RSUs vested during the period. During the
years ended December 31, 2009, December 31, 2010, and December 31, 201 1, the amount of cash received from the
exercise of stock options was $350 million, $656 million, and $621 million, and the total direct tax benefit realized, including
the excess tax benefit, from stock-based award activities was $260 million, $355 million, and $451 million. W e have elected
to account for the indirect ef fects of stock-based awardsprimarily the research and development tax creditthrough the
Consolidated Statements of Income.
For the years ended December 31, 2009, December 31, 2010, and December 31, 201 1, we recognized stock-based
compensation and related tax benefits of $1,164 million and $264 million, $1,376 million and $314 million, and $1,974
million and $413 million.
Certain Risks and Concentrations
Our revenues are principally derived from online advertising, the market for which is highly competitive and rapidly
changing. In addition, our revenues are generated from a multitude of vertical market segments in countries around the
world. Significant changes in this industry or changes in customer buying or advertiser spending behavior could adversely
affect our operating results.
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents,
marketable securities, foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents and marketable securities
consist primarily of highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, municipalities in the U.S., debt
instruments issued by foreign governments, mortgage-backed securities, corporate securities, time deposits, and money
market and other funds, including cash collateral received related to our securities lending program. Foreign exchange
contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically
unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. In 2009, 2010, and 201 1, we
generated approximately 47%, 48%, and 46% of our revenues from customers based in the U.S., with the majority of
customers outside of the U.S. located in Europe and Japan. Many of our Google Network Members are in the internet
industry . We perform ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend, but
generally we do not require collateral from our customers. W e maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these
losses have generally been within our expectations.
No individual customer or groups of af filiated customers represented more than 10% of our revenues in 2009, 2010,
and 201 1.
Fair V alue of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of our financial instruments, including cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable,
short-term debt, and accrued liabilities, approximate fair value because of their generally short maturities.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities
We invest our excess cash primarily in highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies,
municipalities in the U.S., debt instruments issued by foreign governments, mortgage-backed securities, corporate
securities, time deposits, and money market and other funds, including cash collateral received related to our securities
lending program. W e classify all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of
purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months as
marketable securities.
Copyright © 2013 www .secdatabase.com . All Rights Reserved.
Please Consider the Environment Before Printing This DocumentWe determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and
reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. W e have classified and accounted for our marketable securities as
available-for-sale. W e may or may not hold securities with stated maturities greater than
58
Copyright © 2013 www .secdatabase.com . All Rights Reserved.
Please Consider the Environment Before Printing This DocumentTable of Contents
12 months until maturity . After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we
may sell these securities prior to their stated maturities. As we view these securities as available to support current
operations, we classify securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable
securities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. W e carry these securities at fair value, and report the
unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders equity , except for unrealized losses determined
to be other-than-temporary , which we record as interest and other income, net. W e determine any realized gains or losses
on the sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a
component of interest and other income, net.
Non-Marketable Equity Securities
We have accounted for non-marketable equity securities primarily at cost because we do not have significant influence
over the underlying investees.
Impairment of Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities
We periodically review our marketable securities, as well as our non-marketable equity securities, for impairment. If we
conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary .
Factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the
decline in value and the potential recovery period, and our intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not that we will be
required to sell, the investment before recovery . If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary , we will write down
the asset to its fair value and take a corresponding charge to our Consolidated Statements of Income.
Accounts Receivable
We record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount and we do not charge interest. W e maintain an allowance for
doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. W e review the accounts receivable by amounts due by
customers which are past due to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues. In determining the
amount of the reserve, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit
evaluations. W e also maintain a sales allowance to reserve for potential credits issued to customers. W e determine the
amount of the reserve based on historical credits issued.
Property and Equipment
We account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. W e compute
depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally two to five years. W e
depreciate buildings over periods up to 25 years. W e amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining
lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Construction in progress is related to the construction or development
of property (including land) and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for our intended use. Depreciation for
equipment commences once it is placed in service and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements commences
once they are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated.
Software Development Costs
We expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of
products to be marketed to external users, before technological feasibility of such products is reached. W e have determined
that technological feasibility was reached shortly before the release of those products and as a result, the development
costs incurred after the establishment of technological feasibility and before the release of those products were not material,
and accordingly , were expensed as incurred.
59

Please Consider the Environment Before Printing This DocumentTable of Contents
Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets
We review property and equipment and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. W e measure recoverability of
these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to
generate. If property and equipment and intangible assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized
equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value. W e have made no material
adjustments to our long-lived assets in any of the years presented. In addition, we test our goodwill for impairment at least
annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that this asset may be impaired. Our tests are
based on our single operating segment and reporting unit structure. W e found no goodwill impairment in any of the years
presented.
Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. W e amortize our acquired
intangible assets on a straight-line basis with definite lives over periods ranging from one to 12 years.
Income T axes
We recognize income taxes under the liability method. W e recognize deferred income taxes for dif ferences between
the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in ef fect for the years in which
differences are expected to reverse. W e recognize the ef fect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates in income in the
period that includes the enactment date.
Foreign Currency
Generally , the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency . We translate the financial
statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average
rates of exchange for revenues, costs, and expenses. W e record translation gains and losses in accumulated other
comprehensive income as a component of stockholders equity . We recorded $77 million of net translation gains in 2009,
$124 million of net translation losses in 2010, and $107 million of net translation losses in 201 1. We record net gains and
losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions as a component of interest and other income, net. These gains and
losses are net of those realized on foreign exchange contracts. W e recorded $8 million of net gains in 2009, $29 million of
net losses in 2010, and $38 million of net losses in 201 1.
Advertising and Promotional Expenses
We expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended
December 31, 2009, December 31, 2010, and December 31, 201 1, advertising and promotional expenses totaled
approximately $353 million, $772 million, and $1,544 million.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 201 1, the F ASB issued an amendment to an existing accounting standard which requires companies to
present net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive,
statements. In addition, in December 201 1, the F ASB issued an amendment to an existing accounting standard which
defers the requirement to present components of reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income
statement. We adopted both standards in the fourth quarter of 201 1.
In September 201 1, the F ASB issued an amendment to an existing accounting standard, which provides entities an
option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing on goodwill is necessary .
Specifically , an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the

value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative
60

impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. This standard is ef fective for annual and interim
goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 201 1.We adopted this standard in the
first quarter of 2012 and the adoption will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
In May 201 1, the F ASB issued a new accounting standard update, which amends the fair value measurement
guidance and includes some enhanced disclosure requirements. The most significant change in disclosures is an
expansion of the information required for Level 3 measurements based on unobservable inputs. The standard is ef fective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 201 1.We adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2012 and the adoption
will not have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures.
Note 2.Net Income Per Share of Class A and Class B Common Stock
We compute net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method. Basic net
income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period except
that it does not include unvested common shares subject to repurchase or cancellation. Diluted net income per share is
computed using the weighted-average number of common shares and the ef fect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding
during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of stock options, warrants issued under the TSO program, restricted
shares, restricted stock units, and unvested common shares subject to repurchase or cancellation. The dilutive ef fect of
outstanding stock options, warrants, restricted shares, and restricted stock units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by
application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A common stock
assumes the conversion of Class B common stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B common stock does
not assume the conversion of those shares.
The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock are
identical, except with respect to voting. Further , there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation,
as well as Delaware law , which preclude our board of directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our
Class A and Class B common stock. Specifically , Delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation
which would have the ef fect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock (in this case
the right of our Class A common stock to receive an equal dividend to any declared on our Class B common stock) must be
approved by the class of stock adversely af fected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate of incorporation
provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it must be approved by the unanimous consent
of our board of directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual
participation rights of the Class A and Class B common shares as if the earnings for the year had been distributed. As the
liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis. Further , as
we assume the conversion of Class B common stock in the computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A
common stock, the undistributed earnings are equal to net income for that computation.

Investment in a Marketable Equity Security
During the fourth quarter of 201 1, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $88 million related to our
investment in Clearwire Corporation. This amount was included in interest and other income, net in the accompanying
Consolidated Statement of Income.
Securities Lending Program
From time to time, we enter into securities lending agreements with financial institutions to enhance investment
income. W e loan selected securities which are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities. Cash collateral is
invested in reverse repurchase agreements. W e classify loaned securities as cash equivalents or marketable securities on
the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We record the cash collateral as an asset with a corresponding liability .
We classify reverse repurchase agreements maturing within three months as cash equivalents and those longer than three
months as receivable under reverse repurchase agreements on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. For
lending agreements collateralized by securities, we do not record an asset or liability as we are not permitted to sell or
repledge the associated collateral.
Note 4.Debt
Short-T erm Debt
We have a debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper . Net proceeds from
this program are used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2010 and 201 1, we had $3.0 billion and $750
million of commercial paper outstanding recorded as short-term debt with weighted-average interest rates of 0.3% and
0.1%. In conjunction with this program, we have a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in July 2016. The interest rate
for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. At December 31, 2010 and 201 1, we
were in compliance with the financial covenant in the credit facility . No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility at
December 31, 2010 and December 31, 201 1.
In December 2010, we issued a secured promissory note in the amount of $468 million with an interest rate of 1.0%
and a one-year maturity date. Proceeds were used for the acquisition of an of fice building in New Y ork City . In December
2011, we extended the maturity date of the note to December 2012. As of December 31, 2010 and 201 1, the outstanding
balance was $468 million.
The estimated fair value of the short-term debt approximated its carrying value at December 31, 2010 and
December 31, 201 1.

Total $2,986
The ef fective interest yields of the 2014, 2016, and 2021 Notes were 1.258%, 2.241%, and 3.734%, respectively .
Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 19 and November 19 of each year . We may redeem the
Notes at any time in whole or from time to time in part at specified redemption prices. W e are not subject to any financial
covenants under the Notes. W e used the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes to repay a portion of our outstanding
commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. The total estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $3.2
billion, which is based on quoted prices for our publicly-traded debt as of December 31, 201 1.
At December 31, 201 1, future principal payments for the Notes were as follows (in millions):

Note 5.Derivative Financial Instruments
We enter into foreign currency contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that our cash flows and earnings
will be adversely af fected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. W e use certain interest rate derivative contracts to
hedge interest rate exposures on our fixed income securities. Our program is not designated for trading or speculative
purposes.
We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets
at fair value. W e record changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of the derivatives in the accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Income as interest and other income, net, as part of revenues, or to accumulated other comprehensive
income (AOCI) in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Cash Flow Hedges
Copyright © 2013 www .secdatabase.com . All Rights Reserved.
Please Consider the Environment Before Printing This DocumentWe use options designated as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar . We initially report any gain on the ef fective portion of a cash flow hedge as a
component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify to revenues when the hedged revenues are
66

Please Consider the Environment Before Printing This DocumentTable of Contents
recorded or as interest and other income, net, if the hedged transaction becomes probable of not occurring. Further , we
exclude the change in the time value of the options from our assessment of hedge ef fectiveness. W e record the premium
paid or time value of an option on the date of purchase as an asset. Thereafter , we recognize any change to this time value
in interest and other income, net.
At December 31, 201 1, the ef fective portion of our cash flow hedges before tax ef fect was $154 million, of which $127
million is expected to be reclassified from AOCI to revenues within the next 12 months.
The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Euros was 3.0 billion (or
approximately $4.1 billion) and 2.8 billion (or approximately $3.8 billion) at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 201 1;
the notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with British pounds was £1.5 billion (or
approximately $2.3 billion) and £1.4 billion (or approximately $2.2 billion) at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 201 1;
and the notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Canadian dollars was C$407 million
(or approximately $382 million) and C$504 million (or approximately $490 million) at December 31, 2010 and December 31,
2011. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities of 36 months or less.
Fair V alue Hedges
We use forward contracts designated as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our investments
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar . Gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in interest and
other income, net, along with the of fsetting losses and gains of the related hedged items. W e exclude changes in the time
value for forward contracts from the assessment of hedge ef fectiveness and recognize them in interest and other income,
net. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with foreign currencies was $787 million
and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 201 1.
Other Derivatives
Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of forward and option contracts that we use to hedge
intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency
of a subsidiary . We recognize gains and losses on these contracts as well as the related costs in interest and other income,
net, along with the gains and losses of the related hedged items. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to
purchase U.S. dollars with foreign currencies was $1.0 billion and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2010 and December 31,
2011. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to sell U.S. dollars for foreign currencies was $84 million and
$472 million at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 201 1. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to
purchase Euros with other foreign currencies was 991million (or approximately $1.3 billion) and 711million (or
approximately $929 million) at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 201 1. The notional principal of foreign exchange
contracts to sell Euros for other foreign currencies was 6million (or approximately $8 million) at December 31, 2010 and
no such contracts were outstanding at December 31, 201 1.
We also use exchange-traded interest rate futures contracts and T o Be Announced (TBA) forward purchase
commitments of mortgage-backed assets to hedge interest rate risks on certain fixed income securities. The TBA contracts
meet the definition of derivative instruments in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest
available delivery date. Our interest rate futures and TBA contracts (together interest rate contracts) are not designated as
hedging instruments. W e recognize gains and losses on these contracts as well as the related costs in interest and other
income, net. The gains and losses are generally economically of fset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying
available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of AOCI until the securities are sold or other-than-
temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are moved from AOCI into interest and other income, net. As of
December 31, 201 1, the total notional amounts of interest rate contracts outstanding were $100 million.

Note 6.Fair V alue Measurements
We measure our cash equivalents, marketable securities, auction rate securities (ARS), and foreign currency and
interest rate derivative contracts at fair value. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a
market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing
an asset or a liability . A three-tier fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for
inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:
Level 1Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
Level 2Include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.
Level 3Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.
The fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
We classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities within Level 1 or Level 2. This is because we value our
cash equivalents and marketable securities using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing
market observable inputs. W e classify our investments in ARS within Level 3 because they are valued using valuation
models with significant unobservable marketable inputs (see below). W e classify our foreign currency and interest rate
derivative contracts primarily within Level 2 as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data
of similar instruments.

(1)This balance represents cash collateral received in connection with our securities lending program, which was
invested in reverse repurchase agreements maturing within three months.
At December 31, 201 1, we held $1 18 million of ARS. Historically , these securities have provided liquidity through a
Dutch auction process. However , these auctions began to fail in the first quarter of 2008. T o estimate their fair values at
December 31, 201 1, we used a discounted cash flow model based on estimated interest rates, timing and amount of cash
flows, the credit quality of the underlying securities, and illiquidity considerations.
At December 31, 201 1, the estimated fair value of these ARS was $23 million below their costs. As we have no intent
to sell these ARS and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these ARS prior to recovery of our entire
cost basis, we concluded the decline in the fair value was temporary and recorded the unrealized loss to AOCI on the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 201 1. To the extent we determine that any impairment is
other-than-temporary , we would record a charge to earnings. In addition, we have concluded that the auctions for these
securities may continue to fail for at least the next 12 months and as a result, we classified them as non-current assets on
the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 201 1.

Note 8.Acquisitions
In April 201 1, we completed the acquisition of IT A Software, Inc. (IT A), a privately-held flight information software
company , for $676 million in cash, of which $394 million was attributed to acquired intangible assets, $323 million to
goodwill, and $41 million to net liabilities assumed.
During the year ended December 31, 201 1, we completed 78 other acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets for
a total cash consideration of approximately $1.3 billion, of which $795 million was attributed to goodwill, $593 million to
acquired intangible assets, and $86 million to net liabilities assumed. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and
depth of our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, our technologies, and our product of ferings.
Pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to the
consolidated results of operations, either individually or in the aggregate.
Patents and developed technology have a weighted-average useful life of 6.3 years, customer relationships have a
weighted-average useful life of 6.6 years and trade names and other have a weighted-average useful life of 4.2 years. The
amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is $29 million.
In August 201 1, we entered into a Merger Agreement with Motorola, a provider of innovative technologies, products
and services that enable a range of mobile and wireline digital communication, information and entertainment experiences,
under which we will acquire Motorola for$40 per share in cash, or a total of approximately $12.5 billion. The completion of
this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. In the event
the Merger Agreement is terminated due to a failure to obtain certain regulatory approvals, we would be required to
payMotorola afeeof $2.5 billion. The transaction is currently expected to close in early 2012.
Note 9.Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies
Operating Leases
We have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our of fices, land, and data
centers throughout the world with original lease periods expiring primarily between 2012 and 2063. W e are committed to
pay a portion of the actual operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements. These operating expenses are not
included in the table below . Certain of these arrangements have free or escalating rent payment provisions. W e recognize
rent expense under such arrangements on a straight-line basis.

Certain leases have adjustments for market provisions. Amounts in the above table represent our best estimates of
future payments to be made under these leases. In addition, the above table does not include future rental income of $726
million related to the leases that we assumed in connection with our building purchases. Rent expense under operating
leases, including co-location arrangements, was $323 million, $293 million, and $380 million in 2009, 2010, and 201 1.
Purchase Obligations
We had $1.9 billion of other non-cancelable contractual obligations, primarily related to payments related to certain of
our distribution arrangements and video and other content licensing revenue sharing arrangements, as well as data center
operations and facility build-outs at December 31, 201 1. In addition, we had $2.8 billion of open purchase orders for which
we had not received the related services or goods at December 31, 201 1. We have the right to cancel these open purchase
orders prior to the date of delivery .
Letters of Credit
At December 31, 201 1, we had unused letters of credit for $46 million.
Indemnifications
In the normal course of business to facilitate transactions of our services and products, we indemnify certain parties,
including advertisers, Google Network Members, and lessors with respect to certain matters. W e have agreed to hold
certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property
infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an
indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification
agreements with our of ficers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.
It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification
agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally , we have a
limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a
material adverse ef fect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However , to the extent that valid
indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. As of December 31, 201 1, we did not have any
indemnification claims that we considered to be probable or reasonably possible.

Legal Matters
Antitrust Investigations
On June 23, 201 1, we received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the U.S. Federal T rade Commissions (FTC)
Bureau of Competition and a subpoena from FTCs Bureau of Consumer Protection relating to a review by the FTC of our
business practices, including search and advertising. State attorneys general from the states of T exas, Ohio, and
Mississippi have issued similar CIDs. W e are cooperating with the FTC and the state attorneys general and responding to
their information requests.
The European Commissions (EC) Directorate General for Competition has also opened an investigation into various
antitrust-related complaints against us. On February 10, 2010, we received notification from the EC about three antitrust
complaints filed by Ciao, Ejustice, and Foundem, respectively . On November 30, 2010, the EC formally opened
proceedings against us. Since November 2010, 1plusV , parent company of Ejustice, and VfT , an association of business
listings providers in Germany , have filed similar complaints against us. On March 31, 201 1, Microsoft Corporation submitted
a similar complaint to the EC against us. On the same day , the EC notified us of additional complaints filed by Elfvoetbal,
Hotmaps, Interactive Labs, and nnpt.it, and on August 30, 201 1 of a complaint by dealdujour .pro. On September 16, 201 1,
we responded to all of the allegations made against us. In addition, in December 201 1, the Spanish Association of Daily
Newspaper Publishers also submitted a complaint to the EC against us. W e are cooperating with the EC and responding to
its information requests.
EPA Investigation
In February 2009, we learned of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EP A) investigation into an alleged release of
refrigerant at one of our smaller data center facilities, which we acquired from DoubleClick, and the accuracy of related
statements and records. W e are cooperating with the EP A and have provided documents and other materials.
Department of Justice Investigation (Advertising)
In connection with the resolution of an investigation by the United States Department of Justice into the use of Google
advertising by certain advertisers, we accrued $500 million during the three months ended March 31, 201 1, which was paid
in August 201 1 upon final resolution of that matter .
Patent and Intellectual Property Claims
We have had patent, copyright, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our
products, services, and technologies, including Android, Google Search, Google AdW ords, Google AdSense, Google
Books, Google News, Google Image Search, Google Chrome, Google T alk, Google V oice, and Y ouTube, infringe the
intellectual property rights of others. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary
damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from of fering certain features, functionalities,
products, or services, and may also cause us to change our business practices, and require development of non-infringing
products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business.
In addition, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them for certain
intellectual property infringement claims against them, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims,
and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Furthermore, such
customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or
otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business.

offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. Such claims, suits, government investigations,
and other proceedings could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other adverse consequences.
Certain of our outstanding legal matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of
damages. W e record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can
be reasonably estimated. W e evaluate, on a monthly basis, developments in our legal matters that could af fect the amount
of liability that has been previously accrued, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to
determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.
With respect to our outstanding legal matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of
reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse ef fect on our business,
consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However , the outcome of such legal matters is
inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.
We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.
Income T axes
We are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and various other tax authorities. W e have reserved for
potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes that may result from examinations by , or any negotiated agreements
with, these tax authorities, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations or agreements will not have a
material ef fect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary , the
reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of tax benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer
necessary . If our estimates of the federal, state, and foreign income tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, a
further charge to expense would result.
Note 13. Stockholders Equity
Convertible Preferred Stock
Our board of directors has authorized 100,000,000 shares of convertible preferred stock, $0.001 par value, issuable in
series. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 201 1, there were no shares issued or outstanding.
Class A and Class B Common Stock
Our board of directors has authorized two classes of common stock, Class A and Class B. At December 31, 201 1,
there were 6,000,000,000 and 3,000,000,000 shares authorized and there were 257,552,401 and 67,342,362 shares
outstanding of Class A and Class B common stock. The rights of the holders of Class A and Class B common stock are
identical, except with respect to voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share
of Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share. Shares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time
at the option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock. W e refer to
Class A and Class B common stock as common stock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless otherwise
noted.
Stock Plans
We maintain the 1998 Stock Plan, the 2000 Stock Plan, the 2003 Stock Plan, the 2003 Stock Plan (No. 2), the 2003
Stock Plan (No. 3), the 2004 Stock Plan, and plans assumed through acquisitions, all of which are collectively referred to as
the Stock Plans. Under our Stock Plans, incentive and nonqualified stock options or rights to purchase common stock
may be granted to eligible participants. Options are generally granted for a term
76

of 10 years. Options granted under the Stock Plans other than the 2004 Stock Plan may be exercised prior to vesting.
Under the Stock Plans, we have also issued RSUs and restricted shares. An RSU award is an agreement to issue shares
of our stock at the time of vest. Except for options granted pursuant to our stock option exchange program completed in
March 2009 (the Exchange), options granted and RSUs issued to employees under the Stock Plans generally vest over
four years contingent upon employment with us on the vesting date.
At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 201 1, there were 27,329,837 and 21,794,492 shares of common stock
reserved for future issuance under our Stock Plans.
We estimated the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the BSM option pricing model. Our
assumptions about stock-price volatility have been based exclusively on the implied volatilities of publicly traded options to
buy our stock with contractual terms closest to the expected life of options granted to our employees. W e estimate the
expected term based upon the historical exercise behavior of our employees. The risk-free interest rate for periods within
the contractual life of the award is based on the U.S. T reasury yield curve in ef fect at the time of grant.
The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the stock options
granted (excluding options granted in connection with the Exchange discussed below) in the periods presented:

The above tables include approximately 1.2 million warrants held by selected financial institutions that were options
purchased from employees under our TSO program, with a weighted-average exercise price of $336.64 and a weighted-
average remaining life of 1.1 years.
During 201 1, the number of shares underlying TSOs sold to selected financial institutions under the TSO program was
635,047 at a total value of $167 million, or an average of $262.74 per share, including an average premium of $1 1.09 per
share. The premium is calculated as the dif ference between (a) the sale price of the TSO and (b) the intrinsic value of the
TSO, which we define as the excess, if any , of the price of our Class A common stock at the time of the sale over the
exercise price of the TSO.
The total grant date fair value of stock options vested during 2009, 2010, and 201 1 was $690 million, $690 million, and
$561 million. The aggregate intrinsic value of all options and warrants exercised during 2009, 2010, and 201 1 was $566
million, $794 million, and $674 million. These amounts do not include the aggregate sales price of options sold under our
TSO program.
As of December 31, 201 1, there was $583 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding employee
stock options. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years. T o the extent the
actual forfeiture rate is dif ferent from what we have estimated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be
different from our expectations.

As of December 31, 201 1, there was $3,727 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested employee
RSUs. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years. T o the extent the actual
forfeiture rate is dif ferent from what we have estimated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be dif ferent
from our expectations.
Note 14. 401(k) Plan
We have a 401(k) Savings Plan (401(k) Plan) that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of
the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 60% of their
eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. Employee and our contributions are fully vested when contributed. W e
contributed approximately $83 million, $100 million, and $136 million during 2009, 2010, and 201 1.
Note 15. Income T axes
Income before income taxes included income from domestic operations of $3,579 million, $4,948 million, and $4,693
million for 2009, 2010, and 201 1, and income from foreign operations of $4,802 million, $5,848 million, and $7,633 million
for 2009, 2010, and 201 1. Substantially all of the income from foreign operations was earned by an Irish subsidiary .

We have not provided U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries as of December 31, 201 1 because we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. If these
foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income
taxes previously paid on these earnings. As of December 31, 201 1, the cumulative amount of earnings upon which U.S.
income taxes have not been provided is approximately $24.8 billion. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred
tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.
Deferred T ax Assets
Deferred income taxes reflect the net ef fects of temporary dif ferences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of our

As of December 31, 201 1, our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were
approximately $420 million and $310 million. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire
in 2018 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2014. The net operating loss carryforwards are
subject to various annual limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.
As of December 31, 201 1, our California research and development credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were
approximately $55 million that can be carried over indefinitely . We believe it is more likely than not that a portion of the state
tax credit will not be realized. Therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance on the state tax credit carryforward in the
amount of $48 million. W e will reassess the valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a partial or full
release of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly .
As of December 31, 201 1, our federal and state capital loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately
$165 million and $422 million. W e also have deferred tax assets for impairment losses that, if recognized, will be capital in
nature. W e believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets for capital losses and impairment losses will
not be realized. Therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance on both our federal and state deferred tax assets for
these items in the amount of $285 million. W e will reassess the valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows
for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly .

Decreases related to settlement with tax authorities (5 )
Balance as of December 31, 201 1 $1,564
Our total unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would af fect our ef fective tax rate were $814 million, $951
million, and $1,350 million as of December 31, 2009, 2010, and 201 1.
As of December 31, 2010 and 201 1, we had accrued $97 million and $129 million for payment of interest and
penalties. Interest and penalties included in our provision for income taxes were not material in all the periods presented.
We and our subsidiaries are routinely examined by various taxing authorities. Although we file U.S. federal, U.S. state,
and foreign tax returns, our two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. and Ireland. During the three months ended
December 31, 2007, the IRS completed its examination of our 2003 and 2004 tax years. W e have filed an

appeal with the IRS for certain issues related to this audit and no resolution of the issues has been achieved at this time,
but we believe we have adequately provided for these items and any adverse results would have an immaterial impact on
our unrecognized tax benefit balance within the next 12 months. The IRS is currently in examination of our 2007, 2008, and
2009 tax years. W e do not expect the examination to be completed within the next 12 months. Therefore, we do not
anticipate any significant impact to our unrecognized tax benefit balance in 2012, related to our 2007, 2008, and 2009 tax
years.
Our 2010 and 201 1 tax years remain subject to examination by the IRS for U.S. federal tax purposes, and our 2003
through 201 1 tax years remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes.
There are various other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements.
Note 16. Information about Geographic Areas
Our chief operating decision-makers (i.e., chief executive of ficer and his direct reports) review financial information
presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by geographic region for
purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. There are no segment managers who are held
accountable by our chief operating decision-makers, or anyone else, for operations, operating results, and planning for
levels or components below the consolidated unit level. Accordingly , we consider ourselves to be in a single reporting
segment and operating unit structure.
Revenues by geography are based on the billing addresses of our customers. The following tables set forth revenues
and long-lived assets by geographic area (in millions):

ITEM 9.CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNT ANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL
DISCLOSURE
None.
ITEM 9A.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our chief executive of ficer and chief financial of ficer, evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of
the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Based on this evaluation, our chief executive of ficer and chief financial of ficer concluded that, as of December 31,
2011, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are ef fective to provide
reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive of ficer and chief
financial of ficer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
December 31, 201 1 that have materially af fected, or are reasonably likely to materially af fect, our internal control over
financial reporting.
Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the ef fectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the T readway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was ef fective as of December 31, 201 1. Management reviewed the results
of its assessment with our Audit Committee. The ef fectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 201 1 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP , an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and
procedures relative to their costs.

Stockholders' Equity
Note 13. Stockholders’ Equity
Convertible Preferred Stock
Our board of directors has authorized 100,000,000 shares of convertible preferred stock, $0.001
par value, issuable in series. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 201 1, there were no shares
issued or outstanding.
Class A and Class B Common Stock
Our board of directors has authorized two classes of common stock, Class A and Class B. At
December 31, 201 1, there were 6,000,000,000 and 3,000,000,000 shares authorized and there were
257,552,401 and 67,342,362 shares outstanding of Class A and Class B common stock. The rights of
the holders of Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Each
share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common
stock is entitled to 10 votes per share. Shares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time
at the option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale or transfer to Class A common
stock. W e refer to Class A and Class B common stock as common stock throughout the notes to these
financial statements, unless otherwise noted.
Stock Plans
We maintain the 1998 Stock Plan, the 2000 Stock Plan, the 2003 Stock Plan, the 2003 Stock Plan
(No. 2), the 2003 Stock Plan (No. 3), the 2004 Stock Plan, and plans assumed through acquisitions,
all of which are collectively referred to as the “Stock Plans.” Under our Stock Plans, incentive and
nonqualified stock options or rights to purchase common stock may be granted to eligible participants.
Options are generally granted for a term of 10 years. Options granted under the Stock Plans other
than the 2004 Stock Plan may be exercised prior to vesting. Under the Stock Plans, we have also
issued RSUs and restricted shares. An RSU award is an agreement to issue shares of our stock at the
time of vest. Except for options granted pursuant to our stock option exchange program completed in
March 2009 (the Exchange), options granted and RSUs issued to employees under the Stock Plans
generally vest over four years contingent upon employment with us on the vesting date.
At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 201 1, there were 27,329,837 and 21,794,492 shares of
common stock reserved for future issuance under our Stock Plans.
We estimated the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the BSM option
pricing model. Our assumptions about stock-price volatility have been based exclusively on the implied
volatilities of publicly traded options to buy our stock with contractual terms closest to the expected life
of options granted to our employees. W e estimate the expected term based upon the historical
exercise behavior of our employees. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of
the award is based on the U.S. T reasury yield curve in ef fect at the time of grant.
The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair values of
the stock options granted (excluding options granted in connection with the Exchange discussed
below) in the periods presented:
YearEnded December 31,

The above tables include approximately 1.2 million warrants held by selected financial institutions
that were options purchased from employees under our TSO program, with a weighted-average
exercise price of $336.64 and a weighted-average remaining life of 1.1 years.
During 201 1, the number of shares underlying TSOs sold to selected financial institutions under
the TSO program was 635,047 at a total value of $167 million, or an average of $262.74 per share,
Copyright © 2013 www .secdatabase.com . All Rights Reserved.
Please Consider the Environment Before Printing This Documentincluding an average premium of $1 1.09 per share. The premium is calculated as the dif ference
between (a) the sale price of the TSO and (b) the intrinsic value of the TSO, which we define as the
excess, if any , of the price of our Class A common stock at the time of the sale over the exercise price
of the TSO.
The total grant date fair value of stock options vested during 2009, 2010, and 201 1 was $690
million, $690 million, and $561 million. The aggregate intrinsic value of all options and warrants
exercised during 2009, 2010, and 201 1 was $566 million, $794 million, and $674 million. These
amounts do not include the aggregate sales price of options sold under our TSO program.
As of December 31, 201 1, there was $583 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to
outstanding employee stock options. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-
average period of 2.1 years. T o the extent the actual forfeiture rate is dif ferent from what we have
estimated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be dif ferent from our expectations.

carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $55 million that can be

tax credit will not be realized. Therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance on the
state tax credit carryforward in the amount of $48 million. W e will reassess the valuation
allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the
valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly .

Our total unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would af fect our ef fective tax
rate were $814 million, $951 million, and $1,350 million as of December 31, 2009, 2010,
and 201 1.
As of December 31, 2010 and 201 1, we had accrued $97 million and $129 million for
payment of interest and penalties. Interest and penalties included in our provision for
income taxes were not material in all the periods presented.
We and our subsidiaries are routinely examined by various taxing authorities.

2007, the IRS completed its examination of our 2003 and 2004 tax years. W e have filed
an appeal with the IRS for certain issues related to this audit and no resolution of the
issues has been achieved at this time, but we believe we have adequately provided for
these items and any adverse results would have an immaterial impact on our
unrecognized tax benefit balance within the next 12 months. The IRS is currently in
examination of our 2007, 2008, and 2009 tax years. W e do not expect the examination
to be completed within the next 12 months. Therefore, we do not anticipate any
significant impact to our unrecognized tax benefit balance in 2012, related to our 2007,
2008, and 2009 tax years.
Our 2010 and 201 1 tax years remain subject to examination by the IRS for U.S.
federal tax purposes, and our 2003 through 201 1 tax years remain subject to
examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are
various other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our
financial statements .

Acquisitions
Note 8.Acquisitions
In April 201 1, we completed the acquisition of IT A Software, Inc. (IT A), a privately-
held flight information software company , for $676 million in cash, of which $394 million
was attributed to acquired intangible assets, $323 million to goodwill, and $41 million to
net liabilities assumed.
During the year ended December 31, 201 1, we completed 78 other acquisitions and
purchases of intangible assets for a total cash consideration of approximately $1.3
billion, of which $795 million was attributed to goodwill, $593 million to acquired
intangible assets, and $86 million to net liabilities assumed. These acquisitions generally
enhance the breadth and depth of our expertise in engineering and other functional
areas, our technologies, and our product of ferings.
Pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented
because they are not material to the consolidated results of operations, either
individually or in the aggregate.
Patents and developed technology have a weighted-average useful life of 6.3 years,
customer relationships have a weighted-average useful life of 6.6 years and trade
names and other have a weighted-average useful life of 4.2 years. The amount of
goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is $29 million.
In August 201 1, we entered into a Merger Agreement with Motorola, a provider of
innovative technologies, products and services that enable a range of mobile and
wireline digital communication, information and entertainment experiences, under which
we will acquire Motorola for$40 per share in cash, or a total of approximately $12.5
billion. The completion of this transaction is subject to customary closing
conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. In the event the Merger
Agreement is terminated due to a failure to obtain certain regulatory approvals, we would
be required to pay Motorola afeeof $2.5 billion. The transaction is currently expected to
close in early 2012.

Net Income Per Share of Class
A and Class B Common Stock Note 2.Net Income Per Share of Class A and Class B Common Stock
We compute net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-
class method. Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding during the period except that it does not include unvested
common shares subject to repurchase or cancellation. Diluted net income per share is
computed using the weighted-average number of common shares and the ef fect of potentially
dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of stock
options, warrants issued under the TSO program, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and
unvested common shares subject to repurchase or cancellation. The dilutive ef fect of
outstanding stock options, warrants, restricted shares, and restricted stock units is reflected in
diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the
diluted net income per share of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of Class B
common stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B common stock does not
assume the conversion of those shares.
The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A and
Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Further , there are a number
of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation, as well as Delaware law , which preclude
our board of directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our Class A
and Class B common stock. Specifically , Delaware law provides that amendments to our
certificate of incorporation which would have the ef fect of adversely altering the rights, powers,
or preferences of a given class of stock (in this case the right of our Class A common stock to
receive an equal dividend to any declared on our Class B common stock) must be approved
by the class of stock adversely af fected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our
certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a
stockholder vote, it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our board of directors. As
a result, the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual
participation rights of the Class A and Class B common shares as if the earnings for the year
had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed
earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis. Further , as we assume the conversion of
Class B common stock in the computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A
common stock, the undistributed earnings are equal to net income for that computation.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of
Class A and Class B common stock (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in

Fair V alue Measurements
Note 6.Fair V alue Measurements
We measure our cash equivalents, marketable securities, auction rate securities
(ARS), and foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts at fair value. Fair value
is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair
value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions
that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability . A three-tier fair value
hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used
in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:
Level 1—Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical
assets or liabilities in active markets.
Level 2—Include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the
marketplace.
Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.
The fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
We classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities within Level 1 or Level 2.
This is because we value our cash equivalents and marketable securities using quoted
market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable
inputs. W e classify our investments in ARS within Level 3 because they are valued using
valuation models with significant unobservable marketable inputs (see below). W e
classify our foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts primarily within Level 2
as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of
similar instruments.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized

(1)This balance represents cash collateral received in connection with our securities
lending program, which was invested in reverse repurchase agreements maturing
within three months.
At December 31, 201 1, we held $1 18 million of ARS. Historically , these securities
have provided liquidity through a Dutch auction process. However , these auctions began
to fail in the first quarter of 2008. T o estimate their fair values at December 31, 201 1, we
used a discounted cash flow model based on estimated interest rates, timing and
amount of cash flows, the credit quality of the underlying securities, and illiquidity
considerations.
Copyright © 2013 www .secdatabase.com . All Rights Reserved.
Please Consider the Environment Before Printing This DocumentAt December 31, 201 1, the estimated fair value of these ARS was $23 million below
their costs. As we have no intent to sell these ARS and it is more likely than not that we
will not be required to sell these ARS prior to recovery of our entire cost basis, we
concluded the decline in the fair value was temporary and recorded the unrealized loss
to AOCI on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 201 1. To
the extent we determine that any impairment is other-than-temporary , we would record a
charge to earnings. In addition, we have concluded that the auctions for these securities
may continue to fail for at least the next 12 months and as a result, we classified them as
non-current assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31,
2011.

Note 4.Debt
Short-T erm Debt
We have a debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of
commercial paper . Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate
purposes. At December 31, 2010 and 201 1, we had $3.0 billion and $750 million of
commercial paper outstanding recorded as short-term debt with weighted-average
interest rates of 0.3% and 0.1%. In conjunction with this program, we have a $3.0 billion
revolving credit facility expiring in July 2016. The interest rate for the credit facility is
determined based on a formula using certain market rates. At December 31, 2010 and
2011, we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the credit facility . No amounts
were outstanding under the credit facility at December 31, 2010 and December 31,
2011.
In December 2010, we issued a secured promissory note in the amount of $468
million with an interest rate of 1.0% and a one-year maturity date. Proceeds were used
for the acquisition of an of fice building in New Y ork City . In December 201 1, we extended
the maturity date of the note to December 2012. As of December 31, 2010 and 201 1, the
outstanding balance was $468 million.
The estimated fair value of the short-term debt approximated its carrying value at
December 31, 2010 and December 31, 201 1.
Long-T erm Debt
In May 201 1, we issued $3.0 billion of unsecured senior notes in three tranches as

arrears on May 19 and November 19 of each year . We may redeem the Notes at any
time in whole or from time to time in part at specified redemption prices. W e are not
subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. W e used the net proceeds from the

denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar . We initially report any gain on the ef fective
portion of a cash flow hedge as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify to revenues when
the hedged revenues are recorded or as interest and other income, net, if the hedged transaction
becomes probable of not occurring. Further , we exclude the change in the time value of the options
from our assessment of hedge ef fectiveness. W e record the premium paid or time value of an option
on the date of purchase as an asset. Thereafter , we recognize any change to this time value in interest
and other income, net.
At December 31, 201 1, the ef fective portion of our cash flow hedges before tax ef fect was $154
million, of which $127 million is expected to be reclassified from AOCI to revenues within the next 12
months.
The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Euros was €3.0
billion (or approximately $4.1 billion) and €2.8 billion (or approximately $3.8 billion) at December 31,
2010 and December 31, 201 1; the notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S.
dollars with British pounds was £1.5 billion (or approximately $2.3 billion) and £1.4 billion (or
approximately $2.2 billion) at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 201 1; and the notional principal of
foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Canadian dollars was C$407 million (or
approximately $382 million) and C$504 million (or approximately $490 million) at December 31, 2010
and December 31, 201 1. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities of 36 months or less.
Fair V alue Hedges
We use forward contracts designated as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our
investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar . Gains and losses on these contracts
are recognized in interest and other income, net, along with the of fsetting losses and gains of the
related hedged items. W e exclude changes in the time value for forward contracts from the
assessment of hedge ef fectiveness and recognize them in interest and other income, net. The notional
principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with foreign currencies was $787
million and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 201 1.
Other Derivatives
Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of forward and option contracts
that we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated
in currencies other than the local currency of a subsidiary . We recognize gains and losses on these
contracts as well as the related costs in interest and other income, net, along with the gains and losses
of the related hedged items. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S.

Please Consider the Environment Before Printing This Documentdollars with foreign currencies was $1.0 billion and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2010 and
December 31, 201 1. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to sell U.S. dollars for foreign
currencies was $84 million and $472 million at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 201 1. The
notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase Euros with other foreign currencies was
€991million (or approximately $1.3 billion) and €711million (or approximately $929 million) at
December 31, 2010 and December 31, 201 1. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to
sell Euros for other foreign currencies was €6million (or approximately $8 million) at December 31,
2010 and no such contracts were outstanding at December 31, 201 1.
We also use exchange-traded interest rate futures contracts and “T o Be Announced” (TBA)
forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to hedge interest rate risks on certain fixed
income securities. The TBA contracts meet the definition of derivative instruments in cases where
physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. Our interest rate
futures and TBA contracts (together interest rate contracts) are not designated as hedging instruments.
We recognize gains and losses on these contracts as well as the related costs in interest and other
income, net. The gains and losses are generally economically of fset by unrealized gains and losses in
the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of AOCI until the
securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are moved from
AOCI into interest and other income, net. As of December 31, 201 1, the total notional amounts of
interest rate contracts outstanding were $100 million.

Commitments and
Contingencies Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies
Operating Leases
We have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain
of our of fices, land, and data centers throughout the world with original lease periods
expiring primarily between 2012 and 2063. W e are committed to pay a portion of the
actual operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements. These operating
expenses are not included in the table below . Certain of these arrangements have free
or escalating rent payment provisions. W e recognize rent expense under such
arrangements on a straight-line basis.
At December 31, 201 1, future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating
leases, net of sublease income amounts, were as follows over each of the next five
years and thereafter (in millions):

2016 256 10 246
Thereafter 1,264 5 1,259
Total minimum payments $2,954 $75 $2,879
Certain leases have adjustments for market provisions. Amounts in the above table
represent our best estimates of future payments to be made under these leases. In
addition, the above table does not include future rental income of $726 million related to
the leases that we assumed in connection with our building purchases. Rent expense
under operating leases, including co-location arrangements, was $323 million, $293
million, and $380 million in 2009, 2010, and 201 1.
Purchase Obligations
We had $1.9 billion of other non-cancelable contractual obligations, primarily related
to payments related to certain of our distribution arrangements and video and other
content licensing revenue sharing arrangements, as well as data center operations and
facility build-outs at December 31, 201 1. In addition, we had $2.8 billion of open
purchase orders for which we had not received the related services or goods at
December 31, 201 1. We have the right to cancel these open purchase orders prior to the
date of delivery .
Letters of Credit
At December 31, 201 1, we had unused letters of credit for $46 million.

Please Consider the Environment Before Printing This DocumentIndemnifications
In the normal course of business to facilitate transactions of our services and
products, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network Members,
and lessors with respect to certain matters. W e have agreed to hold certain parties
harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of
intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of
these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and
the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements
with our of ficers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations
to our agents.
It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount
under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances
involved in each particular agreement. Additionally , we have a limited history of prior
indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have
not had a material adverse ef fect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial
position. However , to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future,
future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse ef fect on
our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. As of December 31, 201 1,
we did not have any indemnification claims that we considered to be probable or
reasonably possible.
Legal Matters
Antitrust Investigations
On June 23, 201 1, we received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the U.S.
Federal T rade Commission’ s (FTC) Bureau of Competition and a subpoena from FTC’ s
Bureau of Consumer Protection relating to a review by the FTC of our business
practices, including search and advertising. State attorneys general from the states of
Texas, Ohio, and Mississippi have issued similar CIDs. W e are cooperating with the FTC
and the state attorneys general and responding to their information requests.
The European Commission’ s (EC) Directorate General for Competition has also
opened an investigation into various antitrust-related complaints against us. On
February 10, 2010, we received notification from the EC about three antitrust complaints
filed by Ciao, Ejustice, and Foundem, respectively . On November 30, 2010, the EC
formally opened proceedings against us. Since November 2010, 1plusV , parent
company of Ejustice, and VfT , an association of business listings providers in Germany ,
have filed similar complaints against us. On March 31, 201 1, Microsoft Corporation
submitted a similar complaint to the EC against us. On the same day , the EC notified us
of additional complaints filed by Elfvoetbal, Hotmaps, Interactive Labs, and nnpt.it, and
on August 30, 201 1 of a complaint by dealdujour .pro. On September 16, 201 1, we
responded to all of the allegations made against us. In addition, in December 201 1, the
Spanish Association of Daily Newspaper Publishers also submitted a complaint to the
EC against us. W e are cooperating with the EC and responding to its information
requests.
EPA Investigation
Copyright © 2013 www .secdatabase.com . All Rights Reserved.
Please Consider the Environment Before Printing This DocumentIn February 2009, we learned of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EP A)
investigation into an alleged release of refrigerant at one of our smaller data center
facilities, which we acquired from DoubleClick, and the accuracy of related statements
and records. W e are cooperating with the EP A and have provided documents and other
materials.
Department of Justice Investigation (Advertising)
In connection with the resolution of an investigation by the United States Department
of Justice into the use of Google advertising by certain advertisers, we accrued $500
million during the three months ended March 31, 201 1, which was paid in August 201 1
upon final resolution of that matter .
Patent and Intellectual Property Claims
We have had patent, copyright, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us
claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies, including Android,
Google Search, Google AdW ords, Google AdSense, Google Books, Google News,
Google Image Search, Google Chrome, Google T alk, Google V oice, and Y ouTube,
infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Adverse results in these lawsuits may
include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements,
or orders preventing us from of fering certain features, functionalities, products, or
services, and may also cause us to change our business practices, and require
development of non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of
revenues for us and otherwise harm our business.
In addition, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to
indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which
would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we
pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Furthermore,
such customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and
technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of
revenues and adversely impact our business.
Other
We are also regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other
proceedings involving competition and antitrust (such as the pending investigations by
the FTC and the EC described above), intellectual property , privacy , tax, labor and
employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services
offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. Such claims,
suits, government investigations, and other proceedings could result in fines, civil or
criminal penalties, or other adverse consequences.
Certain of our outstanding legal matters include speculative claims for substantial or
indeterminate amounts of damages. W e record a liability when we believe that it is both
probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
We evaluate, on a monthly basis, developments in our legal matters that could af fect the
amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and make adjustments as
appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being
and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.
Copyright © 2013 www .secdatabase.com . All Rights Reserved.
Please Consider the Environment Before Printing This DocumentWith respect to our outstanding legal matters, based on our current knowledge, we
believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually
or in the aggregate, have a material adverse ef fect on our business, consolidated
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However , the outcome of such
legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.
We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.
Income T axes
We are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and various other tax
authorities. W e have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes
that may result from examinations by , or any negotiated agreements with, these tax
authorities, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations or agreements
will not have a material ef fect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicate
payment of these amounts is unnecessary , the reversal of the liabilities would result in
the recognition of tax benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer
necessary . If our estimates of the federal, state, and foreign income tax liabilities are less
than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.

PoliciesNote 1.Google Inc. and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Nature of Operations
We were incorporated in California in September 1998. W e were re-incorporated in
the State of Delaware in August 2003. W e generate revenues primarily by delivering
relevant, cost-ef fective online advertising.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Google Inc. and our
wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that af fect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements
and the accompanying notes. Actual results could dif fer materially from these estimates.
On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the accounts
receivable and sales allowances, fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets
and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, fair values of
stock-based awards, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among others. W e base
our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

Google AdW ords is our auction-based advertising program that enables advertisers
to place text-based and display ads on our websites and our Google Network Members’
websites. Display advertising comprises the videos, text, images, and other interactive
ads that run across the web on computers and mobile devices, including smart phones
and handheld computers such as netbooks and tablets. Most of our AdW ords customers
pay us on a cost-per-click basis, which means that an advertiser pays us only when a
user clicks on one of its ads. W e also of fer AdW ords on a cost-per-impression basis that

Please Consider the Environment Before Printing This Documentenables advertisers to pay us based on the number of times their ads appear on our
websites and our Google Network Members’ websites as specified by the advertisers.
Google AdSense refers to the online programs through which we distribute our
advertisers’ AdW ords ads for display on our Google Network Members’ websites, as well
as programs to deliver ads on television broadcasts.
We recognize as revenues the fees charged to advertisers each time a user clicks on
one of the ads that appears next to the search results or content on our websites or our
Google Network Members’ websites. For those advertisers using our AdW ords cost-per-
impression pricing, we recognize as revenues the fees charged to advertisers each time
their ads are displayed on our websites or our Google Network Members’ websites. W e
report our Google AdSense revenues on a gross basis principally because we are the
primary obligor to our advertisers.
We recognize revenues when the services or products have been provided or
delivered, the fees we charge are fixed or determinable, we and our advertisers or other
customers understand the specific nature and terms of the agreed upon transactions,
and collectability is reasonably assured.
We record deferred revenue upon invoicing or when cash payments are received in
advance of our performance in the underlying agreement on the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues consists primarily of traf fic acquisition costs. T raffic acquisition
costs consist of amounts ultimately paid to our Google Network members under
AdSense arrangements and to certain other partners (our distribution partners) who
distribute our toolbar and other products (collectively referred to as access points) or
otherwise direct search queries to our website (collectively referred to as distribution
arrangements). These amounts are primarily based on the revenue share and fixed fee
arrangements with our Google Network Members and distribution partners.
Certain distribution arrangements require us to pay our partners based on a fee per
access point delivered and not exclusively—or at all—based on revenue share. These
fees are non-refundable. Further , these arrangements are terminable at will, although
under the terms of certain contracts we or our distribution partners may be subject to
penalties in the event of early termination. W e recognize fees under these arrangements
over the estimated useful lives of the access points (approximately two years) to the
extent we can reasonably estimate those lives and they are longer than one year , or
based on any contractual revenue share, if greater . Otherwise, the fees are charged to
expense as incurred. The estimated useful life of the access points is based on the
historical average period of time they generate traf fic and revenues. Further , we review
the access points for impairment by distribution partner , type, and geography , and we
have not made any impairment to date.
Prepaid revenue share and distribution fees are included in prepaid revenue share,
expenses, and other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Copyright © 2013 www .secdatabase.com . All Rights Reserved.
Please Consider the Environment Before Printing This DocumentCost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the operation of our
data centers, including depreciation, labor , energy , and bandwidth costs, credit card and
other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions including Google
Checkout transactions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, as well as content
acquisition costs. W e have entered into arrangements with certain content providers
under which we distribute or license their video and other content. In a number of these
arrangements, we display ads on the pages of our web sites from which the content is
viewed and share most of the fees these ads generate with the content providers. T o the
extent we are obligated to make guaranteed minimum revenue share payments to our
content providers, we recognize as content acquisition costs the contractual revenue
share amount or on a straight-line basis, whichever is greater , over the terms of the
agreements.
Stock-based Compensation
We have elected to use the BSM option pricing model to determine the fair value of
stock options on the dates of grant .Restricted stock units (RSUs) are measured based
on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. Shares are
issued on the vesting dates net of the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements to
be paid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, the actual number of shares
issued will be fewer than the actual number of RSUs outstanding. Furthermore, we
record the liability for withholding amounts to be paid by us as a reduction to additional
paid-in capital when paid. Also, we recognize stock-based compensation using the
straight-line method.
We include as part of cash flows from financing activities the benefits of tax
deductions in excess of the tax-ef fected compensation of the related stock-based
awards for options exercised and RSUs vested during the period. During the years
ended December 31, 2009, December 31, 2010, and December 31, 201 1, the amount of
cash received from the exercise of stock options was $350 million, $656 million, and
$621 million, and the total direct tax benefit realized, including the excess tax benefit,
from stock-based award activities was $260 million, $355 million, and $451 million. W e
have elected to account for the indirect ef fects of stock-based awards—primarily the
research and development tax credit—through the Consolidated Statements of Income.
For the years ended December 31, 2009, December 31, 2010, and December 31,
2011, we recognized stock-based compensation and related tax benefits of $1,164
million and $264 million, $1,376 million and $314 million, and $1,974 million and $413
million.
Certain Risks and Concentrations
Our revenues are principally derived from online advertising, the market for which is
highly competitive and rapidly changing. In addition, our revenues are generated from a
multitude of vertical market segments in countries around the world. Significant changes
in this industry or changes in customer buying or advertiser spending behavior could
adversely af fect our operating results.
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk
consist principally of cash equivalents, marketable securities, foreign exchange
Copyright © 2013 www .secdatabase.com . All Rights Reserved.
Please Consider the Environment Before Printing This Documentcontracts, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents and marketable securities consist
primarily of highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies,
municipalities in the U.S., debt instruments issued by foreign governments, mortgage-
backed securities, corporate securities, time deposits, and money market and other
funds, including cash collateral received related to our securities lending program.
Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high
credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from
revenues earned from customers located around the world. In 2009, 2010, and 201 1, we
generated approximately 47%, 48%, and 46% of our revenues from customers based in
the U.S., with the majority of customers outside of the U.S. located in Europe and Japan.
Many of our Google Network Members are in the internet industry . We perform ongoing
evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend,
but generally we do not require collateral from our customers. W e maintain reserves for
estimated credit losses and these losses have generally been within our expectations.
No individual customer or groups of af filiated customers represented more than 10%
of our revenues in 2009, 2010, and 201 1.
Fair V alue of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of our financial instruments, including cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, accounts payable, short-term debt, and accrued liabilities,
approximate fair value because of their generally short maturities.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities
We invest our excess cash primarily in highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S.
government and its agencies, municipalities in the U.S., debt instruments issued by
foreign governments, mortgage-backed securities, corporate securities, time deposits,
and money market and other funds, including cash collateral received related to our
securities lending program. W e classify all highly liquid investments with stated
maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all
highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months as
marketable securities.
We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable
securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance
sheet date. W e have classified and accounted for our marketable securities as available-
for-sale. W e may or may not hold securities with stated maturities greater than 12
months until maturity . After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives, as well as
our liquidity requirements, we may sell these securities prior to their stated maturities. As
we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify
securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption
marketable securities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. W e carry
these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as
a component of stockholders’ equity , except for unrealized losses determined to be
other-than-temporary , which we record as interest and other income, net. W e determine
any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities on a specific
identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of interest
and other income, net.
Copyright © 2013 www .secdatabase.com . All Rights Reserved.
Please Consider the Environment Before Printing This DocumentNon-Marketable Equity Securities
We have accounted for non-marketable equity securities primarily at cost because
we do not have significant influence over the underlying investees.
Impairment of Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities
We periodically review our marketable securities, as well as our non-marketable
equity securities, for impairment. If we conclude that any of these investments are
impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary . Factors we
consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the
impairment, the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period, and
our intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell, the
investment before recovery . If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary , we
will write down the asset to its fair value and take a corresponding charge to our
Consolidated Statements of Income.
Accounts Receivable
We record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount and we do not charge
interest. W e maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially
uncollectible receivables. W e review the accounts receivable by amounts due by
customers which are past due to identify specific customers with known disputes or
collectability issues. In determining the amount of the reserve, we make judgments
about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations.
We also maintain a sales allowance to reserve for potential credits issued to customers.
We determine the amount of the reserve based on historical credits issued.
Property and Equipment
We account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. W e compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, generally two to five years. W e depreciate buildings over
periods up to 25 years. W e amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the
remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Construction in
progress is related to the construction or development of property (including land) and
equipment that have not yet been placed in service for our intended use. Depreciation
for equipment commences once it is placed in service and depreciation for buildings and
leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for our intended use. Land is
not depreciated.
Software Development Costs
We expense software development costs, including costs to develop software
products or the software component of products to be marketed to external users, before
technological feasibility of such products is reached. W e have determined that
technological feasibility was reached shortly before the release of those products and as
a result, the development costs incurred after the establishment of technological
feasibility and before the release of those products were not material, and accordingly ,
were expensed as incurred.

Please Consider the Environment Before Printing This DocumentLong-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets
We review property and equipment and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable. W e measure recoverability of these assets by
comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are
expected to generate. If property and equipment and intangible assets are considered to
be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying
value of the asset exceeds its fair market value. W e have made no material adjustments
to our long-lived assets in any of the years presented. In addition, we test our goodwill
for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that this asset may be impaired. Our tests are based on our single operating
segment and reporting unit structure. W e found no goodwill impairment in any of the
years presented.
Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
We amortize our acquired intangible assets on a straight-line basis with definite lives
over periods ranging from one to 12 years.
Income T axes
We recognize income taxes under the liability method. W e recognize deferred
income taxes for dif ferences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in ef fect for the years in which dif ferences are
expected to reverse. W e recognize the ef fect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates
in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Foreign Currency
Generally , the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local
currency . We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars
using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of
exchange for revenues, costs, and expenses. W e record translation gains and losses in
accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders’ equity . We
recorded $77 million of net translation gains in 2009, $124 million of net translation
losses in 2010, and $107 million of net translation losses in 201 1. We record net gains
and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions as a component of interest and
other income, net. These gains and losses are net of those realized on foreign exchange
contracts. W e recorded $8 million of net gains in 2009, $29 million of net losses in 2010,
and $38 million of net losses in 201 1.
Advertising and Promotional Expenses
We expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are
incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2009, December 31, 2010, and
December 31, 201 1, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $353
million, $772 million, and $1,544 million.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 201 1, the F ASB issued an amendment to an existing accounting
standard which requires companies to present net income and other comprehensive
Copyright © 2013 www .secdatabase.com . All Rights Reserved.
Please Consider the Environment Before Printing This Documentincome in one continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements. In
addition, in December 201 1, the F ASB issued an amendment to an existing accounting
standard which defers the requirement to present components of reclassifications of
other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement. We adopted both
standards in the fourth quarter of 201 1.
In September 201 1, the F ASB issued an amendment to an existing accounting
standard, which provides entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to
determine whether further impairment testing on goodwill is necessary . Specifically , an
entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it
isnecessary to perform the current two-step test. If an entity believes, as a result of
itsqualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a
reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is
required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. This standard is ef fective for annual
and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 201 1.We adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2012 and the
adoption will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
In May 201 1, the F ASB issued a new accounting standard update, which amends the
fair value measurement guidance and includes some enhanced disclosure requirements.
The most significant change in disclosures is an expansion of the information required
for Level 3 measurements based on unobservable inputs. The standard is ef fective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 201 1.We adopted this standard in the first
quarter of 2012 and the adoption will not have a material impact on our financial
statements and disclosures.

Use of Estimates
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that af fect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements
and the accompanying notes. Actual results could dif fer materially from these estimates.
On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the accounts
receivable and sales allowances, fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets
and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, fair values of
stock-based awards, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among others. W e base
our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

for-sale. W e may or may not hold securities with stated maturities greater than 12
months until maturity . After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives, as well as
our liquidity requirements, we may sell these securities prior to their stated maturities. As
we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify
securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption
marketable securities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. W e carry
these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as
a component of stockholders’ equity , except for unrealized losses determined to be
other-than-temporary , which we record as interest and other income, net. W e determine
any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities on a specific
identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of interest
and other income, net.

Securities Non-Marketable Equity Securities
We have accounted for non-marketable equity securities primarily at cost because
we do not have significant influence over the underlying investees.
Impairment of Marketable and
Non-Marketable Securities Impairment of Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities
We periodically review our marketable securities, as well as our non-marketable
equity securities, for impairment. If we conclude that any of these investments are
impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary . Factors we
consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the
impairment, the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period, and
our intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell, the
investment before recovery . If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary , we
will write down the asset to its fair value and take a corresponding charge to our
Consolidated Statements of Income.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts Receivable
We record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount and we do not charge
interest. W e maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially
uncollectible receivables. W e review the accounts receivable by amounts due by
customers which are past due to identify specific customers with known disputes or
collectability issues. In determining the amount of the reserve, we make judgments
about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations.
We also maintain a sales allowance to reserve for potential credits issued to customers.
We determine the amount of the reserve based on historical credits issued.
Property and Equipment
Property and Equipment
We account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. W e compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, generally two to five years. W e depreciate buildings over
periods up to 25 years. W e amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the
remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Construction in
progress is related to the construction or development of property (including land) and
equipment that have not yet been placed in service for our intended use. Depreciation
for equipment commences once it is placed in service and depreciation for buildings and
leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for our intended use. Land is
not depreciated.
Software Development Costs
Software Development Costs
We expense software development costs, including costs to develop software
products or the software component of products to be marketed to external users, before
technological feasibility of such products is reached. W e have determined that
technological feasibility was reached shortly before the release of those products and as
a result, the development costs incurred after the establishment of technological
feasibility and before the release of those products were not material, and accordingly ,
were expensed as incurred.

Goodwill and Other Acquired
Intangible AssetsLong-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets
We review property and equipment and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable. W e measure recoverability of these assets by
comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are
expected to generate. If property and equipment and intangible assets are considered to
be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying
value of the asset exceeds its fair market value. W e have made no material adjustments
to our long-lived assets in any of the years presented. In addition, we test our goodwill
for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that this asset may be impaired. Our tests are based on our single operating
segment and reporting unit structure. W e found no goodwill impairment in any of the
years presented.
Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
We amortize our acquired intangible assets on a straight-line basis with definite lives
over periods ranging from one to 12 years.
Income T axes
Income T axes
We recognize income taxes under the liability method. W e recognize deferred
income taxes for dif ferences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in ef fect for the years in which dif ferences are
expected to reverse. W e recognize the ef fect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates
in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Foreign Currency
Foreign Currency
Generally , the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local
currency . We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars
using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of
exchange for revenues, costs, and expenses. W e record translation gains and losses in
accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders’ equity . We
recorded $77 million of net translation gains in 2009, $124 million of net translation
losses in 2010, and $107 million of net translation losses in 201 1. We record net gains
and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions as a component of interest and
other income, net. These gains and losses are net of those realized on foreign exchange
contracts. W e recorded $8 million of net gains in 2009, $29 million of net losses in 2010,
and $38 million of net losses in 201 1.
Advertising and Promotional
Expenses Advertising and Promotional Expenses
We expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are
incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2009, December 31, 2010, and
December 31, 201 1, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $353
million, $772 million, and $1,544 million.

Pronouncements Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Please Consider the Environment Before Printing This DocumentIn June 201 1, the F ASB issued an amendment to an existing accounting
standard which requires companies to present net income and other comprehensive
income in one continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements. In
addition, in December 201 1, the F ASB issued an amendment to an existing accounting
standard which defers the requirement to present components of reclassifications of
other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement. We adopted both
standards in the fourth quarter of 201 1.
In September 201 1, the F ASB issued an amendment to an existing accounting
standard, which provides entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to
determine whether further impairment testing on goodwill is necessary . Specifically , an
entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it
isnecessary to perform the current two-step test. If an entity believes, as a result of
itsqualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a
reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is
required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. This standard is ef fective for annual
and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 201 1.We adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2012 and the
adoption will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
In May 201 1, the F ASB issued a new accounting standard update, which amends the
fair value measurement guidance and includes some enhanced disclosure requirements.
The most significant change in disclosures is an expansion of the information required
for Level 3 measurements based on unobservable inputs. The standard is ef fective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 201 1.We adopted this standard in the first
quarter of 2012 and the adoption will not have a material impact on our financial
statements and disclosures.
