ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
NVIDIA
 is  the  world  leader  in  visual  computing.  It  enables  us  to  open  up  new  avenues  of  exploration,  facilitate  creativity  and  discovery,  and  powerbreakthroughs in new areas lik
e artificial intelligence, virtual reality and autonomous cars.Beginning
 as  a  PC  graphics  chip  company,  NVIDIA  has  transformed  into  a  specialized  platform  company  that  targets  four  large  markets  -  Gaming,Professional
 Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive - where visual computing is essential and valued. We are focused on delivering value through PC, mobileand
 cloud architectures. Our vertical integration enables us to bring together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, systems and services to createunique value for the mark
ets we serve.Innovation
 is  at  our  core.  We  have  invested  $12  billion  in  research  and  development  since  our  inception,  yielding  some  7,300  patent  assets,  includinginventions essential to
 modern computing. The GPU introduced the world to the power of programmable graphics. Our invention of CUDA has enabled the GPU’sparallel
 processing capabilities to be harnessed to accelerate general purpose computing. And our invention of the virtualized GPU has put the power of parallelprocessing into the cloud, ac
cessible from virtually any connected device, anywhere.Gamers
 choose NVIDIA GPUs to enjoy immersive fantasy worlds, which will increasingly be experienced in virtual reality. Professional designers use themto
 create visual effects in movies and design products ranging from soft drink bottles to commercial aircraft. Researchers use them to accelerate a wide range ofimportant
 applications,  from  simulations  of  viruses  to  the  revolution  in  deep  learning,  which  has  broad  applications  ranging  from  analyzing  scientific  data  tofacilitating everyday tasks.
Our
 GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla for researchers and analysts focused onartificial
 intelligence, deep learning and big-data; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. We also integrate our GPUs into powerful mobile system-on-a-chip
 (SOC) processors, which drive supercomputing capabilities for tablets and online gaming and entertainment devices, as well as autonomous robots, dronesand
 cars.  Our  Tegra  brand  integrates  an  entire  computer  onto  a  single  chip,  incorporating  GPUs  and  multi-core  CPUs  with  audio,  video  and  input/outputcapabilities.
Headquartered in Santa Clar
a, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.Our Businesses
Our
 two reportable segments - GPU and Tegra Processor - are based on a single underlying architecture. From our proprietary processors, we have createdplatforms that address 
four large markets where our visual computing expertise is critical: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter, and Automotive.Businesses

Table of ContentsOur Markets
We
 specialize  in  markets  in  which  visual  computing  and  accelerated  computing  platforms  are  important.  These  platforms  incorporate  hardware,  systemssoftware, programmable 
algorithms, systems and services to deliver value that is unique in the marketplace.Gaming
Computer
 gaming is one of the largest entertainment industries. Helping to propel it are the launch of new gaming titles, the rise of eSports - competitiveonline gaming - and t
he new realm of virtual reality.Our
 GPUs  enhance  the  gaming  experience  by  improving  the  visual  quality  of  graphics,  increasing  the  frame  rate  for  smoother  gameplay  and  improvingrealism by replicating the behavior of light and physical objects. These can be enjoyed indepe
ndently or together to extend the gaming experience across platforms.Our
 gaming platforms utilize sophisticated 3D software and algorithms - including our GameWorks investment in real-time graphics and simulation. Theseenable us
 to deliver realism and immersion, even when playing games remotely from the cloud. We further enhance gaming with GeForce Experience, our gamingapplication
 that optimizes the PC user’s settings for each title and enables players to record and share their victories. It has been downloaded by more than 70million users.
Our products for
 the gaming market include GeForce GTX GPUs for PC gaming, the SHIELD family of tablet and portable devices for mobile gaming, GRIDfor cloud-based stream
ing on gaming devices, and development services for gaming platforms.Professional Visualization
We
 serve the Professional Visualization market by working closely with independent software vendors to optimize their offerings for NVIDIA GPUs. Ourvisual
 computing solutions enhance productivity for critical parts of the workflow for such major industries as automotive, media and entertainment, oil and gas,and medical imaging - whe
re our GPUs improve productivity and introduce new capabilities.For
 designers who build the products we use every day, it is critical that what they see digitally mirrors reality. This requires simulating the physical behaviorof light and materia
ls, or physically-based rendering, an emerging trend in professional design. Our Iray and DesignWorks software delivers this to designers. Theyenable
 an  architect  designing  a  building  with  a  computer-aided  design  package  to  interact  with  the  model  in  real  time,  view  the  model  in  greater  detail,  andgenerate
 photorealistic renderings for the client. And they enable an automotive designer to create a highly realistic 3D image of a car, which can be viewed fromall angles, reducing re
liance on creating costly, time-consuming full-scale clay models.Just
 as virtual reality is becoming more important in gaming, there is a growing number of enterprise applications - within medicine, architecture, productdesign
 and retailing - that we are helping to enable for virtual experiences. Virtual car showrooms, surgical training, and bringing historical scenes to life are earlyexamples of this technology d
eployed.Visual computing is vital to p
roductivity in many environments, including:•
Design and Manufacturing  -  including computer-aided design, architectural design, consumer-products manufacturing, medical instrumentationand aerospace
•
Digital Content Creation  - including professional vid eo editing and post production, special effects for films and broadcast-television graphics•
Enterprise Graphics Virtualization -  including enterprises that virtualize their IT infrastructure using software from companies such as VMware,Inc. and Citrix Systems, Inc., which a
re significantly improved by NVIDIA GRID hardware and softwareOur
 brand  for  this  market  is  Quadro  for  workstations.  Quadro  GPUs  enhance  the  productivity  of  designers  by  improving  performance  and  addingfunctionality, such as photor
ealistic rendering, high color fidelity and advanced scalable display capabilities. 5
Table of ContentsDatacenter
The
 NVIDIA Tesla accelerated computing platform greatly increases the performance and power efficiency of high-performance computers and datacentersystems by applying the paral
lel-processing of GPUs and enabling software to solve general-purpose computing problems. Tesla-based servers and supercomputersincrease
 the  speed  of  applications  used  in  such  fields  as  aerospace,  bio-science  research,  mechanical  and  fluid  simulations,  energy  exploration,  deep  learning,computational financ
e and data analytics.Accelerated
 computing is recognized as the path forward for high performance computing amid the slowing of Moore’s Law - which postulates the doublingof transistors every 18-24 months.
 The proportion of supercomputers utilizing accelerators has grown sharply over the past five years, now accounting for one-fifthof the
 systems on the Top 500 list and one-third of the list’s total floating-point operations per second. Tesla GPU accelerators power the fastest supercomputers inthe United States,
 Japan and Europe. They will also drive the U.S. Energy Department’s next generation of supercomputers at Oak Ridge and Lawrence LivermoreNational Laboratories.
Tesla
 has had a significant impact on scientific discovery, including improving heart surgery, HIV research and mapping human genome folds. Tesla GPUsand
 our  cuDNN  software  have  been  broadly  adopted  for  deep  learning,  a  new  computing  method  for  enabling  artificial  intelligence.  Deep  learning  enablescomputers
 to  learn  for  themselves  and  perform  tasks,  like  recognizing  images,  text  and  speech  -  in  some  cases  better  than  humans.  Leading  web-servicescompanies
 are using GPUs to improve consumer cloud services. The use of deep learning is growing rapidly in many industries, automating such tasks as readingmedical imaging, survey
ing coral on the sea bottom and robotically thinning lettuce harvests to maximize crop yields.We
 also serve the Datacenter market with GRID for virtualized graphics. GRID makes it possible to run graphics-intensive applications remotely on a serverin
 the datacenter,  instead of locally  on a PC or workstation.  Applications  include  accelerating  virtual  desktop infrastructures  and delivering  graphics-intensiveapplications from the 
cloud.Automotive
The automotive technology
 market has grown tremendously as the car itself is becoming a powerful computer. Cars will feature a multitude of devices, drivenby
 sophisticated software algorithms. These devices will be designed to ensure our safety and the safety of those around us, enhance our comfort and enjoyment,and search and navigate. They wi
ll use the tools of deep learning to sense their environment, ultimately driving themselves.Our
 products  are  in  more  than  10  million  cars  on  the  road  today,  powering  infotainment,  navigation  and  virtual  cockpit  systems  from  a  broad  range  ofautomakers.
 
To
 enable autonomous driving, NVIDIA delivers an end-to-end solution - consisting of NVIDIA DIGITS and DRIVE PX - for both training a deep neuralnetwork,
 as well as deploying the output of that network in a car. DIGITS is a tool for developing, training and visualizing deep neural networks that can run onany
 NVIDIA GPU-based system. The trained neural net model runs within the car on NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2, an artificial intelligence platform that can utilizemany configurations offe
ring processing power greater than 150 Macbook Pro notebooks.  
Beyond
 Automotive, we see the opportunity for Tegra in other embedded areas where visual computing is valued. Examples include robots that respond tovoice and gesture commands, d
rones that process enormous amounts of visual-based data and smart monitors powered by Android that make a PC optional.Business Strategies
NVIDIA’s key strategies that shape ou
r overall business approach include:Extending our technology leadership in
 visual computing. We believe  that visual computing is fundamental to the continued expansion and evolution ofcomputing.
 We  apply  our  research  and  development  resources  to  extending  our  leadership  in  visual  computing,  enabling  us  to  enhance  the  userexperience for consumer entertai
nment and professional visualization applications.6
Table of ContentsExtending our visual computing leadership into mobile and cloud-
computing platforms. We believe that visua l computing will remain a key componentin
 the computing paradigm circumscribed by mobile, cloud and software as a service. We enable interactive graphics applications - such as games, movieand
 photo editing and design software - to be accessed by any device, anywhere. We believe that the user experience in virtual desktop infrastructuresshould
 be  indistinguishable  from  physical  environments  and,  accordingly,  leverage  our  research  and  development  resources  to  create  differentiateddevices and products that de
liver this capability.Revolutionizing
 computing with the GPU’s parallel processing capability. We  believe that the massively parallel processing capabilities of NVIDIAGPUs
 can solve complex computational  problems in significantly  less time and with less power consumption than a CPU. We work with developersworldwide
 who write programs for the CUDA platform using various high-level programming languages. Developers are able to accelerate applicationsin areas ranging from molec
ular dynamics to image processing, derivatives modeling for financial risk analysis and big-data analytics.Protecting
 our intellectual property, and using it to enter into license and development contracts. We  believe our intellectual property portfolio is avaluable
 asset that can be monetized by licensing our technology to customers and partners that desire to build such capabilities directly into their ownproducts. Such license and develop
ment arrangements can further enhance the reach of our graphics and mobile technology.Enabling visual
 computing platforms in key focus areas. We  believe that we are well-positioned to use our expertise in visual and parallel computing tomake contributions in four k
ey markets where our visual computing expertise is valued:- 
Gaming :
Our strategy is to use advanced graphics technologies to create a range of gaming platforms, stretching across PCs, mobile devicesand the cloud.
- 
Professional  Visualization :  Our  strategy  is  to  serve  as  our  customers'  most  trusted  graphics  partner,  working  closely  with  independentsoftware vendors to optimiz
e their offerings for NVIDIA GPUs.- 
Datacenter :
 Our strategy is to serve growing demand for deep learning, big-data analytics and scientific computing.- 
Automotive :  Our  strategy  is  to  utilize  Tegra’s  visual  computing  capabilities  to  augment  the  driving  experience,  as  well  as  leverage  oursignificant supercomputin
g capabilities to accelerate autonomous driving.Sales and Marketing
Our worldwide
 sales and marketing strategy is key to achieving our objective of providing markets with our high-performance and efficient GPUs and mobileSOC
 products. Our sales and marketing teams, located across our global markets, work closely with each industry's respective original equipment manufacturers,or
 OEMs, original device manufacturers, or ODMs, system builders, motherboard manufacturers, add-in board manufacturers, or AIBs, retailers/distributors andindustry trendsetters, collectively referred to as
 our Channel, to define product features, performance, price and timing of new products. Members of our sales teamhave
 a high level of technical expertise and product and industry knowledge to support the competitive and complex design win process. We also employ a highlyskilled
 team of application engineers to assist our Channel in designing, testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products. We believe that thedepth
 and quality of our design support are keys to improving our Channel's time-to-market, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction within our Channeland fostering relationsh
ips that encourage our customers and partners to use the next generation of our products.As
 a result of our Channel strategy, a small number of our customers represent the majority of our revenue. Sales to ASUSTeK Computer Inc., accounted for11% 
of our total revenue for fiscal year 2016. To
 encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized for platforms utilizing our products and enterprise applications optimizedfor
 our GPUs, we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community. Engineering and marketing personnel interact withand
 visit key software developers to promote and discuss our products, as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical problems. Our developerprogram
 makes certain that our products are available to developers prior to volume availability in order to encourage the development of software applicationsand game titles that are optimize
d for our products.As NVIDIA’s business has evolved from gaming to broader areas
 and from chips to platforms, so, too, have our avenues to market. SHIELD products, such asour gaming tablet and Android TV devi
ce, are sold through e-tail channels and through some of the world’s largest retailers.7
Table of ContentsBacklog
Our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders. The quantit
y of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment schedules aresubject to revisions that 
reflect changes in both the customers' requirements and in manufacturing availability. The semiconductor industry is characterized by shortlead
 time orders and quick delivery schedules. In light of industry practice and experience, we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is non-cancelableand that the dollar amoun
t associated with the non-cancelable portion is not significant.Seasonality
Our
 GPU and Tegra processor products serve many markets from consumer PC gaming to enterprise workstations to government and service provider clouddatacenters;
 however, a majority of our revenue is consumer focused. Our consumer products have typically seen stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscalyear. However, there can be no assu
rance that this trend will continue.Manufacturing
We
 do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products. Instead, we utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy for all ofour
 product-line operating segments whereby we employ world-class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly,testing
 and packaging. This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in suchareas
 as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability and testing. In addition, this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs andrisks associated
 with owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products, suchas substrates and a varie
ty of components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of the majority of the raw materials used in the production of our products.As a result, we can focus our resour
ces on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing and customer support.We
 utilize  industry-leading  suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor  Manufacturing  Company Limited  and Samsung Electronics  Co. Ltd, to produce oursemiconductor
 wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., BYD Auto Co. Ltd., Hon Hai PrecisionIndustry
 Co.,  Ltd.,  JSI  Logistics  Ltd.,  King  Yuan  Electronics  Co.,  Ltd.  and  Siliconware  Precision  Industries  Company  Ltd.  to  perform  assembly,  testing  andpackaging
 of  most  of  our  products  and  platforms.  We  purchase  substrates  from  IbidenCo.,  Ltd.,  Nanya  Technology  Corporation,  and  Unimicron  TechnologyCorporation.
We
 typically  receive  semiconductor  products  from  our  subcontractors,  perform  incoming  quality  assurance  and  then  ship  the  semiconductors  to  contractequipment
 manufacturers, or CEMs, distributors, motherboard and AIB customers from our third-party warehouse in Hong Kong. Generally, these manufacturersassemble
 and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications, and then ship our products to retailers, system builders or OEMs as motherboard andadd-in board solutions.
Working Capital
We
 focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other working-capital-related items. We manage inventories by communicating with ourcustomers
 and partners and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a product-by-product basis. We then place manufacturing orders for ourproducts
 that are based on forecasted demand. The quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisionsthat
 reflect changes in both the customers' requirements and in manufacturing availability. We generally maintain substantial inventories of our products becausethe semiconductor industry 
is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules. A substantial amount of our inventories are maintained as semi-finished products that can b

able securities balances increased by 9% to $5.04 billion at the end of fiscal ye ar 2016 compared with the end of fiscal year 2015.We
 believe  that  these  balances  and  our  anticipated  cash  flows  from  operations  will  be  sufficient  to  meet  our  operating,  acquisition,  capital  expenditure  andintended capital re

Table of ContentsResearch and Development
 
We
 believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading visual computing technology is essential to our futuresuccess.
 Our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of GPUs and Tegra Processors, including GPUs forhigh-performance
 computing, and Tegra SOCs for SHIELD and other mobile products using independent design teams. Our research and development effortsinclude software enginee
ring, hardware engineering, very large scale integration design engineering, process engineering, architecture and algorithms.A
 critical  component  of  our  product  development  effort  is  our  partnerships  with  industry  leaders.  We  invest  significant  resources  in  the  development  ofrelationships with
 industry leaders, often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products. We believe that forming these relationships andutilizing
 next-generation  development  tools  to  design,  simulate  and  verify  our  products  will  help  us  remain  at  the  forefront  of  visual  computing  and  developproducts
 that  utilize  leading-edge  technology  on  a  rapid  basis.  We  believe  in  leveraging  our  significant  research  and  development  depth  and  scale  to  createdifferentiated products.
 
As
 of January  31, 2016 ,  we had 6,566 full-time  employees engaged in research and development. During fiscal years 2016 ,  2015 and 2014, we incurredresearch and developmen
t expense of $1.33 billion , $1.36 billion and $ 1.34 billion , respectively. Competition
 
The
 market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and declining averageselling
 prices. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners anddistribution
 channels, software support, conformity to industry standard Application Programming Interfaces, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing andtotal
 system costs. We believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customersand
 partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. Weexpect
 competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours, or may provide betterperformance
 or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge andacquire significant market share.
A
 significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs and mobile SOC products. Some of our competitors mayhave greater marke
ting, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes. 
Our current competitors 
include:•
suppliers  of  discrete  and  integrated  GPUs,  including  supercomputers  and  chipsets  that  incorporate  3D  graphics  functionality  as  part  of  their  existingsolutions, such as Advanced Micro Devic
es, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;•
suppliers  of  SOC  products  that  are  embedded  into  automobiles  and  smart  devices  such  as  televisions,  monitors,  set-top  boxes,  gaming  devices  andautomobiles,
 such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Apple, Inc., Avago Technologies Ltd., Intel, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Mediatek, Mobileye N.V.,Qualcomm Incorporated, Renes
as Electronics Corporation, Samsung, ST Microelectronics, and Texas Instruments Incorporated; and•
licensors of graphics technologies, such as ARM Holdings plc, or ARM, and Imagination Technologies Group plc.9
Table of ContentsPatents and Proprietary Rights
We
 rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements toprotect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. Our curre
ntly issued patents have expiration dates from April 2016 to December 2034. Wehave numerous patents issued, allowed and pe
nding in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate toour
 products  and  the  technology  used  in  connection  with  our  products.  We  also  rely  on  international  treaties,  organizations  and  foreign  laws  to  protect  ourintellectual
 property. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may notprotect
 our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy ofour
 technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies basedon such factors as:
• 
the location in which our produc ts are manufactured;• 
our strategic technology o r product directions in different countries;• 
the degree to which intel lectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and• 
the commercial sign ificance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and regions.We
 have also licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in some of our products and for defensive reasons, and expect to continue to enter intosuch license agreements.
Employees
 
As
 of January  31, 2016 ,  we had 9,227 employees, 6,566 of  whom were engaged in research and development and 2,661 of  whom were engaged in sales,marketing, operations and

If we are unable to successfully compet
e in our target markets, our revenue and financial results will be adversely impacted . NVIDIA-branded
 products and services are visual computing platforms that address four large markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter, andAutomotive.
 Our  products,  services  and  technologies  are  designed  to  meet  the  evolving  needs  of  these  markets;  however,  these  markets  remain  extremelycompetitive, and
 we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product and/or service offerings, industry standards continue to evolve andnew
 competitors enter these markets. Our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to identify and develop new products, services and technologies,and
 enhancements to our existing products, services and technologies, in a timely and cost-effective manner and to achieve consumer and market acceptance ofthem.
If
 we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets, including in significant international markets such as China, demand for our products, servicesand technologies could decr
ease which would cause our revenue to decline and our financial results to suffer. In addition, if we fail to anticipate the changing needsof our target markets 
and emerging technology trends, our business will be harmed.Our
 competitors’ products, services and technologies may be less costly, or may offer superior functionality or different features than ours. In addition, manyof
 our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, andgreater
 financial,  sales,  marketing  and  distribution  resources  than  we  do.  These  competitors  may  be  able  to  more  effectively  identify  and  capitalize  uponopportunities
 in  new  markets  and  end  user  customer  trends,  quickly  transition  their  semiconductor  products  to  increasingly  smaller  line  width  geometries  andobtain sufficient foundry 
capacity and packaging materials, which could harm our business.If we fail to successfully exe
cute our transitions to new business models and markets, our results of operations could suffer.In
 connection with our diversification into new business models, we have transformed into a specialized platform company, targeting markets where visualcomputing
 is  essential  and  valued.  Our  business  strategy  is  dependent  on  creating  products  and  services  that  anticipate  customer  requirements  and  emergingindustry
 trends. We cannot assure you that our new strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers andpartners.
 We also devote significant resources to the development of technologies and business offerings in markets where our operating history is less extensive,such
 as the automotive market. These new offerings and markets may require a considerable investment of technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketingresources.
 If  demand  for  products  and  services  from  these  growth  markets  is  below  our  expectations  or  if  we  are  not  able  to  improve  the  cost  or  operationalefficiencies
 of these new business models, we may not realize benefits from our strategy. Alternatively, we may not be able to effectively implement our strategy,or
 adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve, in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities or meet competitive challenges. If we are unable tosuccessfully establish new of
ferings in light of the competitive environment, our results of operations could suffer.If we do not replace our Intel licensing revenues, our financia
l results may be adversely affected.In
 January 2011, we entered into a patent cross licensing agreement under which Intel agreed to pay us an aggregate of $1.50 billion over six years. The final$200
 million payment under this agreement was received in January 2016. We will be recognizing revenue under this agreement through the first quarter of fiscalyear 2018.
 If we do not enter into new licensing agreements or if the Intel agreement is not offset by other growth in income our financial results may be adverselyaffected.

Table of ContentsIf
 our products fail to achieve expected manufacturing yields, our financial results could be adversely impacted and our reputation with our customersand partners may be harmed.
Manufacturing
 yields  for  our  products  are  a  function  of  product  design,  which  is  developed  largely  by  us,  and  process  technology,  which  typically  isproprietary
 to the foundry. Low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure. We do not know whether a yield problem will existuntil our
 design is actually manufactured by the foundry. As a result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require usand
 the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem. Because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry capacity, any decrease in manufacturing yieldscould
 result in higher manufacturing costs and require us to allocate our available product supply among our customers and partners. Lower than expected yieldscould harm customer or pa
rtner relationships, our reputation and our financial results.If
 our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects, our reputation could be damaged and we couldlose market share.
Our
 products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication,packaging,
 materials and/or use within a system. Our products are used by a variety of industries, including the automotive industry. Failure of our products toperform
 to specifications, or other product defects, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers, the end product in which ourdevice
 has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to incursignificant
 warranty, support and repair or replacement costs, cause us to lose market share, and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our productdevelopment
 efforts to find and correct the issue. In addition, an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement ofcommercial
 shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins and harm our relationships with customers and partners andconsumers’
 perceptions of our brand. Also, we may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including costs to repair or replace products inthe
 field. A product recall, particularly an automotive recall, or a significant number of product returns could be expensive, damage our reputation, result in theshifting
 of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us such as product liability suits. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost ofdefending
 the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business. Further, our businessliability insurance may be i
nadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.System
 security  and  data  protection  breaches,  as  well  as  cyber-attacks,  could  disrupt  our  operations,  reduce  our  expected  revenue  and  increase  ourexpenses, which could adversely affect our sto
ck price and damage our reputation.Security
 breaches, computer malware and cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years. These attacks have occurred on oursystems
 in the past and may occur in the future. Experienced computer programmers, hackers and employees may be able to penetrate our security controls andmisappropriate
 or  compromise  our  confidential  information,  or  that  of  our  employees  or  third  parties.  These  attacks  may  create  system  disruptions  or  causeshutdowns.
 These  hackers  may  also  develop  and  deploy  viruses,  worms  and  other  malicious  software  programs  that  attack  or  otherwise  exploit  securityvulnerabilities in our products, including consumer and autom
otive products, where we utilize over-the-air updates to improve functionality over time. For portionsof
 our IT infrastructure, including business management and communication software products, we rely on products and services provided by third parties. Theseproviders
 may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems. Data security breaches may also result from non-technicalmeans, such as actions by an emp
loyee with access to our systems.Actual or
 perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information orsensitive
 or confidential data about us, our partners, our customers or third parties could expose the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information,resulting
 in  litigation  and  potential  liability,  damage  to  our  brand  and  reputation  or  other  harm  to  our  business.  Our  efforts  to  prevent  and  overcome  thesechallenges
 could increase our expenses and may not be successful. We may experience interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potentialcustomers. Such disruptions could adv
ersely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customersas a result of these disrup
tions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.13
Table of ContentsWe
 depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test and/or package our products, which reduces our control over productquantity and quality, development, enhancement and product d
elivery schedule and could harm our business . We
 do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our GPUs and Tegra processors and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. Instead, we aredependent
 on industry-leading foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., to manufacture oursemiconductor
 wafers  using  their  fabrication  equipment  and  techniques.  Similarly,  we  do  not  assemble,  test  or  package  our  products,  but  instead  rely  onindependent
 subcontractors, such as Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., BYD Auto Co., Ltd., Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., JSI Logistics, Ltd.,King
 Yuan Electronics Co. and Siliconware Precision Industries Co. Ltd. We do not have long-term commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors.As
 a result, we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and/or negatively impact our businessoperations, gross margin, rev
enue and/or financial results, including:•
a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices due to supply constraints;•
a failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate manufacturing or test capacity for our products;•
a failure to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality, leading-edge process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry processtechnologies, needed to manu
facture our products profitably or on a timely basis;•
loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volumeproduction or testing in the 
event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier;•
a lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality; and•
delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize ourcompetitors’ orders ove
r our orders or otherwise.We also
 rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements, and tobring
 such  new  products  and  enhancements  to  market  in  a  timely  manner.  In  the  past,  we  have  experienced  delays  in  the  introduction  of  products  andenhancements
 as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products.The
 design  requirements  necessary  to  meet  consumer  demands  for  more  features  and  greater  functionality  from  our  products  may  exceed  the  capabilities  ofavailable
 software development tools. If we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools, we could losemarket share and our rev
enues could decline.If we fail to achieve design wins for our products, our business will be harm
ed.For
 our products that we do not sell directly to consumers, achieving design wins is an important success factor. Our OEM, ODM, and AIB and motherboardmanufacturers' custom
ers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year, typically based on spring and fall design cycles or in connectionwith
 trade shows. If OEMs, ODMs, and AIB and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products in their systems, they will typically not use our productsin their systems until a
t least the next design configuration. In order to achieve design wins, we must:• 
anticipate the fe atures and functionality that customers and consumers will demand;•
incorporate those features and functionalities into products that meet the exacting design requirements of our customers; and• 
price our products compet itively.Unanticipated
 changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and softwaredevelopers.
 Further, if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards, our customers may not incorporate our products into their designstrategies.
14
Table of ContentsBusiness disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs.
Our
 worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons,fires, extreme weather
 conditions, medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic events or climate change. The occurrenceof
 any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses, a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses. Any of thesebusiness
 disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. Our corporate headquarters, and a portion of ourresearch
 and development activities, are located in California, and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, near majorearthquake
 faults known for seismic activity. In addition, a majority of our principal IT datacenters are located in California, making our operations vulnerable tonatural
 disasters or other business disruptions occurring in this geographical area. The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products andother
 critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China and Korea. Our operations could be harmed if manufacturing,logistics or
 other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, information technologysystem
 failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party
 foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographicalareas is unknown. In the event of a 
major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event, our revenue could decline and our business may be harmed.We receive a significant amount of our re
venue from a limited number of customers and our revenue could decline if we lose any of these customers.We
 receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers. Revenue from significant customers, those representing 10% or more oftotal
 revenue, was 11%  of  our total revenue from one customer in both fiscal year 2016 and 2015 and 21% of our total revenue from two customers in fiscal year2014.
 Our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers, as well as the ability of thesecustomers
 to  sell  products  that  incorporate  our  GPUs  and  Tegra  processors.  In  the  future,  these  customers  may  decide  not  to  purchase  our  products  at  all,  topurchase fewer products than 
they did in the past, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way, particularly because:•
most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, which permits our customers to cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little orno notice to us and without penalty;
•
our customers may develop their own solutions;•
our customers may purchase products from our competitors; or•
our customers may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products.The loss
 of any of our large customers or a significant reduction in purchases by them would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations, andany difficulties in collecting
 accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial condition.We
 maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments andobtain credit insurance over the
 purchasing credit extended to these customers. In the future, we may have to record additional provisions or write-offs and/or deferrevenue
 on certain sales transactions, which could negatively impact our financial results, and we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit weextend to these customers o
r in amounts that we deem sufficient.Our gross margin depends on a number of factors and changes in any of these factors could adverse
ly affect our gross margin.Our
 gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors, including the mix of our products sold, average selling prices, introduction of new productsand
 services, process node transitions, product transitions, sales discounts, pricing actions by our competitors, the cost of product components and the yield ofwafers
 produced by the foundries that manufacture our products. We are focused on improving our gross margin and if we are not able to control or estimate theimpact
 of the above factors or other factors we do not foresee, our gross margins may be negatively impacted. In addition, gross margins for our Tegra processorsare
 lower than our overall corporate gross margins. If Tegra processors comprise a higher percentage of our future revenue, or if we continue to enter into newbusiness areas with compara
tively lower margins, our overall gross margins may decline.15
Table of ContentsIf we fail to estimate custo
mer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed.We
 manufacture our GPUs and Tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand. In order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker deliveryschedules
 for our customers, we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, or may build inventory anticipating demand for aproduct
 that does not materialize. In estimating demand, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect. Situations that may result inexcess or obsolete inventory 
include:• 
changes in business and economic conditions, including downturns in our target markets and/or overall economy;• 
changes in consumer confiden ce caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit market;• 
a sudden and significant dec rease in demand for our products;• 
a higher incidence of inv entory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;• 
our introduction of new products r esulting in lower demand for older products;• 
less demand than expected for newly-introduced products; or• 
increased competit ion, including competitive pricing actions.In
 addition,  the  cancellation  or  deferral  of  customer  purchase  orders  could  result  in  our  holding  excess  inventory,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  grossmargins.
 In addition, because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter, we may not be able to reduce our inventorypurchase
 commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals. We could be required to write-down our inventory to the lower ofcost or market or
 write-off excess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand, any of whichcould harm our financia
l results.Conversely,
 if  we  underestimate  our  customers'  demand  for  our  products,  our  foundry  partners  may  not  have  adequate  lead-time  or  capacity  to  increaseproduction
 and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers' orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase production levels tomeet
 customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner. If we fail to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, ourcustomer relationships 
could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged.We are subject to risks and uncertainties associa
ted with international operations which may harm our business.We
 conduct  our  business  worldwide  and  we  have  offices  in  various  countries  outside  of  the  United  States.  Our  semiconductor  wafers  are  manufactured,assembled,
 tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States and Other Americas. We also generate a significant portion of our revenuefrom
 sales  to  customers  outside  the  United  States  and  Other  Americas.  Revenue  from  sales  to  customers  outside  of  the  United  States  and  Other  Americasaccounted for  
79% of total  revenue for fiscal year 2016 and 75% of total revenue for both fiscal year 2015 and 2014. The global nature of our business subjects usto a number of risks and uncer
tainties, including:•
international economic and political conditions, such as political tensions between countries in which we do business;•
unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements;  •
differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices;•
local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engagingin by the Foreign Corrupt Practic
es Act and other anticorruption laws and regulations;•
exporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions; •
financial risks such as longer payment cycles, difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and foreign exchange rate fluctuations; and•
increased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations, such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and pollution limits.If sales to any of our custom
ers outside of the United States and Other Americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors, our revenue maybe negatively impacted.

Table of ContentsWe
 may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic  benefits of business acquisitions or strategic  investments and we may not be able tosuccessfully integrate acquisit
ion targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.We
 have in the past acquired and invested in, and intend to continue to acquire and invest in, other businesses that offer products, services and technologiesthat
 we  believe  will  help  expand  or  enhance  our  existing  products  and  business.  Any  of  the  following  risks  associated  with  past  or  future  acquisitions  orinvestments could impai
r our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products, and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth orour financial results:
•
difficulty in combining the technology, products, operations or workforce of the acquired business with our business;•
diversion of capital and other resources, including management's attention;•
assumption of liabilities;•
incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;•
potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with product quality, architecture and development, or legal and financialcontingencies, among other 
things; and•
impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s, employees, vendors and customers, as a result of our acquisition or investment.Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Common Stock and Other Matters
Actions
 to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we areunsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or sel
ling our products.We
 have  in  the  past,  currently  are,  and  may  in  the  future  become  involved  in  lawsuits  or  other  legal  proceedings  alleging  patent  infringement  or  otherintellectual property rights violations by us, our
 employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement. An unfavorable ruling inany
 such  intellectual  property  related  litigation  could  include  significant  damages,  invalidation  of  a  patent  or  family  of  patents,  indemnification  of  customers,payment of lost profits, or, when 
it has been sought, injunctive relief.We
 may  commence  litigation  or  other  legal  proceedings  in  order  to  protect  our  intellectual  property  rights.  Such  proceedings  may increase  our  operatingexpenses, which
 could negatively impact our operating results. Further, we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation. If infringementclaims
 are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s patent or intellectual property, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek alicense
 to  the  third  party’s  patent  or  other  intellectual  property  rights.  However,  we  may  not  be  able  to  obtain  licenses  at  all  or  on  terms  acceptable  to  usparticularly
 from our competitors. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in oneof
 our products, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We mayalso
 have to make royalty or other payments, or cross license our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, ourbusiness
 could be negatively impacted.  Furthermore,  the indemnification  of a customer  or other indemnitee may increase  our operating  expenses which couldnegatively impact our op
erating results.We
 rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements, and thelaws of
 the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. The laws of certain foreign countries may notprotect
 our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology andproducts
 more  likely.  We  continuously  assess  whether  and  where  to  seek  formal  protection  for  existing  and  new  innovations  and  technologies,  but  cannot  becertain whether our appl
ications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether we will be able to enforce such protections.17
Table of ContentsOur
 operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securitiesanalysts or investors, our stock price could dec
line.Our
 operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors. For example, our operating expensesrepresent
 a  significant  portion  of  total  revenue  and  are  largely  independent  of  revenue  in  any  particular  period.  In  particular,  our  research  and  developmentexpenses
 reflect  multi-year  commitments  to  the  development  of  new  products  and  enhancements  that  will  not  result  in  revenue,  if  any,  until  future  periods.Therefore, investors should not 
rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance.Factors that could affe
ct our results of operations in the future include:•
demand and market acceptance for our products and services and/or our customers’ products;•
the successful development and volume production of our next-generation products;•
our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;•
new product and service announcements or product and service introductions by our competitors;•
our introduction of new products in accordance with OEMs’ design requirements and design cycles;•
changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our customers’ products;•
the level of growth or decline of the PC industry in general;•
seasonal fluctuations associated with the PC and consumer products market;•
contraction in automotive and consumer end-market demand due to adverse regional or worldwide economic conditions;•
slower than expected growth of demand for new technologies;•
fluctuations in the availability of manufacturing capacity or manufacturing yields;•
our ability to reduce the manufacturing costs of our products;•
competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices;•
product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues;•
rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders;•
the loss of a significant customer;•
substantial disruption in the operations of our foundries or other third-party subcontractors, as a result of a natural disaster, equipment failure, terrorism orother causes;
•
supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our customers’ products, including memory devices;•
costs associated with the repair and replacement of defective products;•
unexpected inventory write-downs or write-offs;•
legal and other costs related to defending intellectual property and other types of lawsuits;•
availability of software and technology licenses at commercially reasonable terms for the continued sale or development of new products;•
customer bad debt write-offs;•
changes  in  our  effective  tax  rate  as  a  result  of  changes  in  the  mix  of  earnings  in  countries  with  differing  statutory  tax  rates,  applicable  tax  laws  orinterpretations of t
ax laws;•
any unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities;•
unexpected costs related to our ownership of real property;•
costs to comply with new government regulations and regulatory enforcement actions;•
costs to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting;•
changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards; and•
general macroeconomic events and factors affecting the overall semiconductor industry and our target markets.Any
 one  or  more  of  the  factors  discussed  above  could  prevent  us  from  achieving  our  expected  future  financial  results.  Any  such  failure  to  meet  ourexpectations or the expectations of our investors
 or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility and, as a result,investors may suffer losses.
In
 the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. Wehave been in
 the past, and may be in the future, the target of securities litigation. Such lawsuits generally result in the diversion of management's time and attentionaway from business operations,
 which could harm our business. In addition, the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation, a ruling against us, or asettlement of the l
itigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results.18
Table of ContentsPrivacy
 concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products andservices.
Our products
 and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws andregulations.
 Concerns  about  our  practices  with  regard  to  the  collection,  use,  retention,  security  or  disclosure  of  personal  information  or  other  privacy-relatedmatters, even if unfounded, 
could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results.Worldwide
 regulatory authorities are considering various legislative proposals concerning data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application ofconsumer and
 data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid, and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that isinconsistent
 with our data practices. If so, we may be ordered to change our data practices and/or be fined. Complying with these changing laws could cause us toincur substantial costs, which 
could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We are subject to risks associated with de
velopment and construction of our headquarters building under an operating lease financing arrangement.In
 fiscal year 2016, we began to construct a new headquarters building in Santa Clara, California, which is currently targeted for completion in the fourthquarter
 of fiscal year 2018. We may encounter unanticipated occurrences or conditions during construction that may increase the expense of the project. We mayalso
 encounter  unanticipated  delays  in  the  construction  of  the  new  building  and  final  city  approval  for  occupancy  may  be  delayed.  We  are  financing  thisconstruction
 under an operating lease arrangement described below. Delays and cost overruns during construction could result in a default under the operatinglease financing arr
angement which could result in liabilities and expenses and could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.Additionally,
 any such difficulties could result in our default under the operative agreements entered into with a syndicate of banks that are participants to theoperating lease financing arrangement to finance development and construction of our head
quarters. We have pledged our assets that relate to the new headquartersbuilding in
 order to secure our obligations under the operating lease financing arrangement. We will need to maintain compliance with the requirements governingsuch
 agreements, including compliance with financial and other covenants, certain of which may be subject to events outside of our control. If we fail to complywith
 the covenants, we may be unable to obtain or utilize all or a portion of the financing contemplated by the operating lease financing arrangement. Further,noncompliance with such covenan
ts or other event of default could lead to a termination of our lease of the property, and the lenders could have the right to, amongother
 things, foreclose on the collateral for our obligations under the operating lease financing arrangement. A loss of financing for the new headquarters buildingor foreclosure on the col
lateral could adversely affect our liquidity and business.We
 have  a  substantial  amount  of  indebtedness  which  could  adversely  affect  our  financial  position  and  prevent  us  from  implementing  our  strategy  orfulfilling our contractual obligations 
. In December 2013, we issued $1.5 billion o
f 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018, or 1.00% Notes. Our substantial indebtedness may:•
limit our ability to use our cash flow or borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and otherpurposes;  
•
make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations;•
place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and•
increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.Additionally,
 our obligation to make payments related to the 1.00% Notes when converted or due could impact our cash balance and limit our ability to useour
 cash for our capital return program and our other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and other generalcorporate purposes.
The exercise of warrants associated with our 1.00% Notes would dilute 
the ownership interest of our existing shareholders.The
 warrants issued concurrently with our 1.00% Notes will be deemed to be automatically exercised on certain dates between March 2019 and June 2019,unless
 the  warrant  holder  notifies  us  otherwise.  Any  issuance  by  us  of  shares  upon  exercise  of  the  warrants  will  dilute  the  ownership  interest  of  our  existingshareholders.
 Any sales in the public market by the warrant holder of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants could adversely affect prevailing marketprices of our common stock.

 law  and  provisions  in  our  certificate  of  incorporation,  our  bylaws  and  our  agreement  with  Microsoft  Corporation  could  delay  or  prevent  achange in control.
Our status as a Delaware corpor
ation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change incontrol
 by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interestedshareholder, even if a
 change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisionsthat could make it mor
e difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions include the following:• 
the ability of our Board of Dir ectors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval;• 
the prohibition of sharehold er action by written consent;• 
advance notice requir ements for director nominations and shareholder proposals;• 
the ability of our Board of Dir ectors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval;• 
a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;• 
the inability of our s hareholders to call special meetings of shareholders; and• 
the ability of our Board of Dir ectors to make, amend or repeal our bylaws.On
 March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology toMicrosoft and its licens
ees for use in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30%of
 the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. The Microsoft provision and the otherfactors
 listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficultfor shareholders to ele

Our
 headquarters complex is located in Santa Clara, California. It includes eight leased commercial buildings totaling 896,565 square  feet and real propertythat
 we own, which consists of six commercial buildings on 36 acres of land. During fiscal year 2016, we began to construct a new headquarters building in SantaClara, California, which is cu
rrently targeted for completion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. In addition, we also lease datacenter space in Santa Clara.Outside
 of  Santa  Clara,  we  lease  space  in  Austin,  Texas  and  a  number  of  regional  facilities  in  other  U.S.  locations,  which  are  used  as  research  anddevelopment centers and/or

 common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common stock began on January 22,1999.
 Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of March 11, 2016, we had approximately 342 registered shareholders, not includingthose
 shares held in street or nominee name. The following table sets forth for the periods indicated the high and low sales price for our common stock as quotedon the NASDAQ Global Select Market:

 On May 7, 2015, we increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.085 per
 share to $0.0975 per share, or $0.39 on an annual basis. On November 5, 2015, weagain increased
 our quarterly cash dividend to $0.115 per share, or $0.46 on an annual basis. In fiscal years 2016 and 2015, we paid $213 million and $186 million, respectively, in cash div
idends to our common shareholders.Our
 cash  dividend  program  and  the  payment  of  future  cash  dividends  under  the  program  are  subject  to  continued  capital  availability  and  our  Board  ofDirectors'
 continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders and are incompliance with all laws and agreements of NVIDIA ap
plicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends. In fiscal year 2016, based upon our earnings andprofits,
 100% of our dividend payments were considered to be a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is possible that a portion of our dividendpayments in future fisc
al years may be considered a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes.Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Beginning
 August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock. In May 2015, theBoard extended the previously au
thorized repurchase program through December 2018 and authorized an additional $1.62 billion under the repurchase program.Through January
 31, 2016, we have repurchased an aggregate of 231 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $3.85 billion. As ofJanuary
 31, 2016, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $1.47 billion through December2018. We intend to return approx
imately $1.00 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2017 in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends.21
Table of ContentsThe
 repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and maybe
 made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, subject tomarket conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does n
ot obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock andthe
 program may be suspended at any time at our discretion. As part of our share repurchase program, we have entered into, and we may continue to enter into,structured share
 repurchase transactions with financial institutions. These agreements generally require that we make an up-front payment in exchange for the rightto
 receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement, and a potential incremental number of shares of our common stock,within a pre-determin
ed range, at the end of the term of the agreement.The

In November 2015, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement, or ASR, with an investment bank, under which we made an upfront paymentof
 $135 million to purchase shares of our common stock. We received an initial delivery of 3,047,106 shares in November 2015 at an average price per shareof
 $44.30, which is based solely on the result of dividing the $135 million we had paid towards the ASR by such 3,047,106 shares. In January 2016, at thetime
 of settlement of the ASR, we received an additional 1,205,682 shares without any further cash payment. The total number of shares repurchased underthis ASR
 was 4,252,788 shares, and thus the average price we ultimately paid per share under the ASR was $31.74. Please refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated
 Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the accelerated share repurchaseprogram.
In
 addition to our share repurchase program, we withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligationsupon
 the vesting of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs,under
 our  equity  incentive  program.  During  fiscal  year  2016,  we  withheld  approximately  3  million  shares  at  a  total  cost  of $66  million through  net  sharesettlements.
 Please refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for furtherdiscussion regarding our equity

 grew 7% in fiscal year 2016 to a record $5.01 billion. GPU revenue was $4.19 billion, up 9% from the previous year, reflecting growth in GeForceGPUs
 for gaming and Tesla products for datacenter. Tegra Processor revenue was $559 million, down 3% from the previous year, reflecting a decline in Tegraproducts
 for OEMs, partially offset by an increase in Tegra products for automotive and development services. License revenue from our patent license agreementwith Intel remained f
lat at $264 million for fiscal year 2016.Gross
 margin for fiscal year 2016 was a record 56.1%, up 60 basis points from the previous year, led by the strength in GPU business revenue partially offsetby lower Tegra Processor business gross m

Business
During
 fiscal year 2016, we released many new products, including the GeForce GTX TITAN X, GeForce GTX 980 Ti, GeForce GTX 980 for notebook, andthe
 GeForce  GTX  950.  These  GPUs  deliver  better  performance  and  power  efficiency  than  their  predecessors  and  helped  double  the  number  of  users  of  ourGeForce
 Experience PC gaming platform from a year earlier. Additionally, we released NVIDIA GameWorks VR, a software development kit that creates moreimmersive gameplay
 on virtual reality-ready desktops and notebooks and enables professional designers to bring virtual reality to applications. We also announcedthe GeForce GTX VR Ready program to help users discov
er systems that will provide optimized virtual reality experiences. 
We
 introduced the Quadro M6000, a powerful professional GPU, and the Quadro Visual Computing Appliance, which contains eight M6000 GPUs. We alsorolled
 out NVIDIA Iray plugins for Autodesk Maya and Autodesk 3ds Max, which enable users to create designs incorporating real-world lights and materialsfaster and easier th
an before, and enabled professional designers to bring virtual reality to applications, with the launch of NVIDIA DesignWorks VR.We
 announced our next-generation Pascal GPU architecture. This architecture is expected to accelerate deep learning applications faster than our current-generation
 Maxwell processors. In addition, we unveiled our next generation virtualized graphics platform - NVIDIA GRID 2.0, which delivers graphics-intensiveapplications to connect

Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s
 discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have beenprepared in accordance with
 accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires usto
 make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies.On
 an  on-going  basis,  we  evaluate  our  estimates,  including  those  related  to  revenue  recognition,  inventories,  income  taxes,  goodwill,  cash  equivalents  andmarketable
 securities, stock-based compensation, and litigation, investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies. We base our estimates on historicalexperience
 and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgmentsabout the carrying value
s of assets and liabilities.We
 believe  the  following  critical  accounting  policies  affect  our  significant  judgments  and  estimates  used  in  the  preparation  of  our  consolidated  financialstatements.
 Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of ourBoard of Directors.
 The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Revenue
Recognition
Product Revenue
We
 recognize  revenue  from  product  sales  when  persuasive  evidence  of  an  arrangement  exists,  the  product  has  been  delivered,  the  price  is  fixed  ordeterminable and collection of
 the related receivable is reasonably assured.For sales to
 certain distributors with rights of return for which the level of returns cannot be reasonably estimated, our policy is to defer recognition of revenueand related cost of rev
enue until the distributors resell the product and, in some cases, when customer return rights lapse.Our
 customer programs primarily involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets. Weaccount
 for rebates as a reduction of revenue and accrue for 100% of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor. While we have a long history ofrebate
 arrangements with OEMs, we believe we are unable to apply our historical experience to reliably estimate the amount of rebates that will eventually beclaimed
 by  individual  OEMs.  In  such  cases,  the  OEMs  may  not  be  our  direct  customers  and  therefore  the  quantity  and  mix  of  demand  they  place  on  theirCEMs/ODMs
 may shift as we introduce new generations and iterations of products and as we experience changes in new competitor offerings. In addition, wetypically
 find that approximately 95% of the rebates we accrue each year are eventually claimed, which is substantially close to 100%, and that this percentagevaries by program and
 by customer. We recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which weoffer
 the rebate. Rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale, unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate.Unclaimed rebates ar
e reversed to revenue, the amount of which typically represents less than 0.5% of total revenue. 
Our
 customer programs also include marketing development funds, or MDFs. MDFs represent monies paid to retailers, system builders, OEMs, distributors,add-in
 card  partners  and  other  channel  partners  that  are  earmarked  for  market  segment  development  and  expansion  and  typically  are  designed  to  support  ourpartners’
 activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. Depending on market conditions, we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customerprograms,
 possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered. We account for MDFs as a reduction of revenue andapply
 a breakage factor to certain types of MDF program accruals for which we believe we can make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount that willultimately be unclaimed. 
We also
 record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarilyon
 historical return rates. However, if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales returnallowances are requir
ed to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.29
Table of ContentsLicense and Development Revenue
For
 license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components, we generally recognize the related revenue over theperiod
 that services are performed. For most license and service arrangements, we determine progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as apercentage
 of the estimated total cost required to complete the project. We periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates tocomplete
 each contract remain accurate. Revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress. Significantmanagement
 judgment and discretion are used to estimate total cost. Any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amountof revenue we recognize in 
any period.For
 license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the licenseagreement, we record reven
ue over the life of the license term, with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified as deferred revenue.Please
 refer  to  Note  1  of  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  Part  IV,  Item  15  of  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  additionalinformation.
Inventories
Inventory
 cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. We charge cost of sales forinventory
 provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or estimated market value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory. Most ofour
 inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments comparedto assumptions about future de
mand and market conditions.Situations
 that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in consumer confidence caused bychanges
 in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology andcustomer
 requirements,  failure  to  estimate  customer  demand  properly  for  older  products  as  newer  products  are  introduced,  or  unexpected  competitive  pricingactions
 by our competition. In addition, cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory. Also, because we oftensell a substantial port
ion of our products in the last month of each quarter, we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner inresponse to customer ca
ncellations or deferrals.The overall net effe
ct on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 1.6%, 0.6% and0.1%
 in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions during these fiscal years were primarilyrelated
 to the write-off of excess quantities of products whose inventory levels were higher than our updated forecasts of future demand for those products. As afabless
 semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so, we must accountfor
 our  third-party  manufacturers'  lead  times  and  constraints.  We  also  adjust  to  other  market  factors,  such  as  product  offerings  and  pricing  actions  by  ourcompetitors, new product tr
ansitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.Please refer to the Gross Prof
it and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.30
Table of ContentsIncome
Taxes
We
 recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by taxjurisdiction.
 We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporarydifferences
 and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on availableevidence and judgment, ar
e not expected to be realized.United
 States income tax has not been provided on a portion of earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to beindefinitely reinvested.
Our
 calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application ofcomplex tax laws. Our estima
tes of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes inaccounting
 standards  or  tax  laws  in  the  United  States,  or  foreign  jurisdictions  where  we  operate,  or  changes  in  other  facts  or  circumstances.  In  addition,  werecognize
 liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxesmay be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessar
y or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required torecognize an income tax be
nefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.As
 of January 31, 2016, we had a valuation allowance of $272 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined arenot
 likely to be realized due, in part, to projections of future taxable income and potential  utilization  limitations  of tax attributes acquired as a result of stockownership changes. To
 the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income taxbenefit during the period.
Goodwill
Goodwill is
 subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist, using eithera qualitative
 or a quantitative assessment. Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carryingvalue.
 We  have  identified  two  reporting  units,  GPU  and  Tegra  Processor,  for  the  purposes  of  completing  our  goodwill  analysis.  Goodwill  assigned  to  thesereporting units as of January 31, 2016 was 
$210 million and $408 million , respectively. Determ ining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reportingunit
 requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assetsand
 liabilities to each of our reporting units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherentlyuncertain.
During the
 fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we elected to use the quantitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit. In applyingthe
 fair value based test of each reporting unit, the results from the income approach and the market approach were equally weighted. These valuation approachesconsider
 a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, terminal or residual values, discount rates andcomparable
 multiples  from  publicly  traded  companies  in  our  industry  and  require  us  to  make  certain  assumptions  and  estimates  regarding  industry  economicfactors and the future p
rofitability of our business.When performing an income
 approach valuation, we incorporate the use of projected financial information and a discount rate that are developed using marketparticipant based assumptions to our discounte
d cash flow model. Our estimates of discounted cash flow were based upon, among other things, certain assumptionsabout
 our expected future operating performance, such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, risk-adjusted discount rates, and future economic and marketconditions.
 Our  estimates  may  differ  from  actual  cash  flow  due  to,  among  other  things,  economic  conditions,  changes  to  our  business  model  or  changes  inoperating
 performance. Additionally, certain estimates of discounted cash flow involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models,which
 increases the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance. The long-term financial forecasts that we utilize represent the best estimatethat
 we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable. Significant differences between our estimates and actual cash flow couldmaterially affect our future financial re
sults, which could impact our future estimates of the fair value of our reporting units.31
Table of ContentsDuring
 the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill. The fair values of our GPU and Tegra Processorreporting
 units  significantly  exceeded  their  respective  carrying  values.  As  such,  even  the  application  of  a  hypothetical  10%  decrease  to  the  fair  value  of  eachreporting
 unit  would  not  have  resulted  in  the  fair  value  of  either  reporting  unit  being  less  than  its  carrying  value.  As  an  overall  test  of  the  reasonableness  ofestimated
 fair values of our reporting units, we reconciled the combined fair value estimates of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of the valuationdate.
 The  reconciliation  confirmed  that  the  fair  values  were  relatively  representative  of  the  market  views  when  applying  a  reasonable  control  premium  to  themarket
 capitalization. However, any significant reductions in the actual amount of future cash flows realized by our reporting units, reductions in the value ofmarket
 comparables, or reductions in our market capitalization could impact future estimates of the fair values of our reporting units. Such events could ultimatelyresult in a charge to our 
earnings in future periods due to the potential for a write-down of the goodwill associated with our reporting units.Our next annual
 evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, or earlier if indicators of potentialimpairment
 exist.  Such  indicators  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  challenging  economic  conditions,  such  as  a  decline  in  our  operating  results,  an  unfavorableindustry or macroeconomic
 environment, a substantial decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions. Such conditions could have theeffect of changing one of the critical
 assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in a decrease in fair valueand require us to record goodwil
l impairment charges.Cash
Equivalents
and
Marketable
Secur
itiesCash
 equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time ofacquisition.  Marketabl
e securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased.  We
 measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value. The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quotedmarket
 prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets. Our Level 1 assets consist of our money market funds. We classifysecurities
 within Level 1 assets when the fair value is obtained from real time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets. Ouravailable-for-sale
 securities are classified as having Level 2 inputs. Our Level 2 assets are valued utilizing a market approach where the market prices of similarassets
 are  provided  by  a  variety  of  independent  industry  standard  data  providers  to  our  investment  custodian.  Most  of  our  cash  equivalents  and  marketablesecurities are valu
ed based on Level 2 inputs. We did not have any investments classified as Level 3 as of January 31, 2016 . All
 of  our  available-for-sale  investments  are  subject  to  a  periodic  impairment  review.  We  record  a  charge  to  earnings  when  a  decline  in  fair  value  issignificantly below cost bas
is and judged to be other-than-temporary, or have other indicators of impairments.If
 the fair value of an available-for-sale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis, an other-than-temporary impairment is triggered in circumstanceswhere (1) we intend to sell the instrument, (2) it
 is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or(3)
 a  credit  loss  exists  where  we  do  not  expect  to  recover  the  entire  amortized  cost  basis  of  the  instrument.  In  these  situations,  we  recognize  an  other-than-temporary
 impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments’ amortized cost basis and its fair value. For available-for-sale debtinstruments
 that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss, if we do not intend to sell and it is more likely than not thatwe
 will not be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis (amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss), weseparate
 the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors. The credit loss component is recognized inearnings.
We
 performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of January 31, 2016. We concluded that our investments were appropriately valued andthat no other than tempor
ary impairment charges were necessary on our portfolio of available-for-sale investments as of January 31, 2016.32
Table of ContentsStock-based
Compensation
Our
 stock-based  compensation  expense  is  associated  with  stock  options,  restricted  stock  units,  or  RSUs,  performance  stock  units  that  are  based  on  ourcorporate
 financial performance targets, or PSUs, performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs, and our employee stockpurchase plan, or ESPP.
Beginning
 in fiscal year 2015, we shifted away from granting stock options and toward granting RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs to reflect changingmarket
 trends for equity incentives at our peer companies. The number of PSUs that will ultimately vest is contingent on the Company’s level of achievementcompared
 with the corporate financial performance target established by our Compensation Committee in the beginning of each fiscal year. The number of sharesof our stock to be received 
at vesting ranges from 0% to 200% of the target amount.We
 use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of RSUs and PSUs,and we use a Monte Carlo simulat
ion on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of market-based PSUs. We use a Black-Scholes valuation at the commencementof an offering period in Ma
rch and September of each year to estimate the fair value of the shares to be issued under our ESPP.Stock-based
 compensation  expense  for  RSUs  and  market-based  PSUs  is  recognized  using  a  straight-line  attribution  method  over  the  requisite  employeeservice period, while comp
ensation expense for PSUs and ESPP is recognized using an accelerated amortization model.Our
 RSU, PSU and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair value of RSUs, PSUs and market-basedPSUs
 is discounted by the dividend yield. Additionally, we estimate forfeitures annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture insubsequent
 periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. If factors change, the compensation expense that we record under these accounting standardsmay differ signific
antly from what we have recorded in the current period.Litigation,
Investigation
and
Se
ttlement
CostsFrom
 time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters.However,
 there  are  many  uncertainties  associated  with  any  litigation  or  investigations,  and  we  cannot  be  certain  that  these  actions  or  other  third-party  claimsagainst
 us will be resolved without costly litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. If that occurs, our business, financial condition and results ofoperations
 could be materially and adversely affected. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation,investigations
 or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S.GAAP.
 However,  the  actual  liability  in  any  such  litigation  or  investigation  may  be  materially  different  from  our  estimates,  which  could  require  us  to  recordadditional costs.

GPU business revenue increased by 9% in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015. This increase was due primarily to increased revenuefrom
 sales of high-end GeForce GPU products for gaming, which increased over 30% reflecting a combination of continued strength in PC gaming and increasedsales
 of our Maxwell-based GPU products. Revenue from Tesla GPUs for Datacenter increased, driven by strong demand from cloud service providers. Revenuefrom
 Quadro  GPUs  for  professional  visualization  declined  due  to  weakness  in  the  overall  workstation  market.  Revenue  from  GeForce  GPU  products  formainstream PC OEMs declined comp

Table of ContentsGross Profit and Gross Margin
 
Gross profit
 consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased fromsubcontractors,
 including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overheadassociated
 with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes development costs forlicense
 and service arrangements and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing. Gross margin is the percentage of gross profitto revenue. 
Our
 overall gross margin was 56.1% , 55.5% and 54.9% for  fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 ,  respectively. The increase over these fiscal years was drivenprimarily by a riche
r product mix in our GPU business, partially offset by lower Tegra business margins.Charges
 to  cost  of  sales  for  inventory  provisions  totaled  $112  million,  $59  million  and  $50  million  for  fiscal  years  2016,  2015  and  2014,  unfavorablyimpacting
 our gross margin by 2.2%, 1.3% and 1.2%, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $32 million for bothfiscal
 year 2016 and 2015 and $43 million for fiscal year 2014, favorably impacting our gross margin by 0.6%, 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively. As a result, theoverall net
 effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 1.6%, 0.6% and 0.1% infiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respe
ctively.A discussion of our gross margin resul
ts for each of our reportable segments is as follows:GPU
Business
.  The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2016 when compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to a richer productmix resulting from stronger sales of our GeForce GP
U products for gaming and lower sales of GeForce GPU products for mainstream PC OEMs. The gross marginof
 our  GPU business  increased  during  fiscal  year  2015  when  compared  to  fiscal  year  2014  due  to  richer  product  mix  resulting  from  strong  sales  of  high-endGeForce GTX GPU products based on our Maxwell archite
cture and the volume increase in our Tesla accelerated computing products.Tegra

Processor
Business.
 The  gross margin of our Tegra Processor business decreased during fiscal year 2016 when compared to fiscal year 2015 due toinventory
 provisions, the warranty charge associated with the SHIELD 8-inch tablet product recall, and a less rich product mix resulting from higher automotiveand SHIELD product
 sales and lower sales of OEM smartphone and tablet products. The inventory provisions related primarily to older generation Tegra products,as well as inventory purchase 
commitments in excess of estimated demand and excess component inventories for SHIELD products. The gross margin of our TegraProcessor
 business decreased during fiscal year 2015 when compared to fiscal year 2014. These decreases were driven primarily by a combination of an overalldecline
 in  margins  of  our  Tegra  products  and  a  less  rich  mix  between  tablet  products,  which  have  had  higher  gross  margins,  and  smartphone  and  automotivemodule products, which have had comp
arably lower gross margins.36

Research and
 development expenses decreased by 2% in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by the wind-downof
 Icera modem operations and other organization efficiencies, partially offset by increases in employee compensation and related costs, including stock-basedcompensation expense.
Research
 and development expenses remained relatively flat during fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. Compensation and benefits increased by$57

 but were unable to identify a viable buyer with genuine interest. As a result, we began the wind-down of Icera modemoperations
 in  the  second  quarter  of  fiscal  year  2016.  The  wind-down  of  Icera  modem  operations  allows  for  continued  investment  in  strategic  growth  areas,including our growth initiat

m 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.Interest Income and Interest Expense
Interest
 income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest anddebt discount amortiza
tion related to the convertible notes issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014.Interest income was 
$39 million , $28 million and $17 million in fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The incr ease in fiscal year 2016 compared tofiscal
 year 2015 was primarily due to higher average cash balances invested in interest bearing securities, as well as higher purchased yields. The increase in fiscalyear
 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to higher average cash balances as we invested the proceeds from the convertible notes we issued in thefourth quarter of fisc
al year 2014 in interest bearing securities.Interest expense was 
$47 million , $46 million and $10 million in fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The  increases in fiscal years 2016 and 2015compared
 to fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively, were primarily due to coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the convertible notes weissued in the fourth quarte
r of fiscal 2014.Other Income and Expense
Other
 income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses from the sale of marketable securities, sales or impairments of investments in non-affiliated companies, and the
 impact of changes in foreign currency rates.Net other income was $ 
4 million , $ 14 million and $ 7 million in fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The decr ease for fiscal year 2016 comparedto
 fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to less gain recognized from sales of non-affiliated investments and more losses from foreign currency remeasurement. Theincrease
 for  fiscal  year  2015  compared  to  fiscal  year  2014  was  primarily  due  to  a  gain  from  the  sale  of  a  non-affiliated  investment,  partially  offset  by  therecognition of an impairment
 loss of a non-affiliated investment and losses from foreign currency remeasurement.  
38
Table of ContentsIncome Taxes
 
We
 recognized income tax expense of $129 million, $124 million and $70 million during fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our annual effectivetax
 rate, was 17.3%, 16.5%, and 13.8% in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The difference in the effective tax rates amongst the three years wasprimarily due to
 an increase in the amount of earnings subject to United States tax in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, partially offset by a net income tax benefit relatedto the Icera modem restructurin
g in fiscal year 2016, and a higher percentage of research tax credit benefit in fiscal year 2014.Our
 effective  tax  rate  for  each  of  the  fiscal  years  was  lower  than  the  United  States  federal  statutory  rate  of  35%  primarily  due  to  income  earned  injurisdictions, including British Virgin
 Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, where the tax rate is lower than the United States federal statutorytax
 rate of 35%, favorable recognition in these fiscal years of the U.S. federal research tax credit and favorable discrete events primarily attributable to the taxbenefit recognized upon
 the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations.Please

Cash
 provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to changes in working capital and higher non-cash
 expenses such as stock-based compensation and restructuring and other charges in fiscal 2016, partially offset by a decline in net income. Cash provided byoperating
 activities increased in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to higher net income from revenue growth and contained operatingexpenses,
 partially  offset  by  an  increase  in  inventories  resulting  from  the  introduction  of  newly  launched  Maxwell-based  GPUs  and  certain  Tegra  SOCs  andSHIELD devices, and an increase in a

Table of ContentsLiquidity
Our
 primary source of liquidity is cash generated by our operations. Our investment portfolio consists principally of cash and cash equivalents, debt securitiesof
 corporations and United States government and its agencies, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises,money
 market funds and foreign government bonds. These investments are denominated in United States dollars. As of January  31, 2016 ,  we did not have anyinvestments in auction-rate 
preferred securities.Please

As of 
January 31, 2016 and January 25, 2015 ,  we had $ 5.04 billion and $ 4.62 billion ,  respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Ourinvestment
 policy  requires  the  purchase  of  high  grade  investment  securities  and  the  diversification  of  asset  types  and  includes  certain  limits  on  our  portfolioduration,
 as  specified  in  our  investment  policy  guidelines.  These  guidelines  also  limit  the  amount  of  credit  exposure  to  any  one  issue,  issuer  or  type  ofinstrument. As of 
January 31, 2016 , we were in compliance with our investment policy. As of January 31, 2016 , our investments in U.S. government ag encies andU.S.
 government sponsored enterprises represented 47% of  our total investment portfolio, while the financial sector accounted for 23% of  our total investmentportfolio. All of our investm
ents are with A/A3 or better rated securities.We
 performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of January  31, 2016 .  Based on our quarterly impairment review, we concluded that ourinvestments were appropri
ately valued and did not record any impairment during fiscal year 2016 .   Net realized gains were $ 
2 million for both fiscal year 2016 and 2014 and were not significant fo r fiscal year 2015. As of January 31, 2016 , the amount of our net
 unrealized gain was not significant. As of January  25, 2015 ,  we had a net unrealized gain of $ 8  million ,  which was comprised of gross unrealized gains of$11 million 
, offset by $ 3 million of gross unrealized losses. Our
 accounts receivable are highly concentrated.  One customer  accounted for 21% of  our accounts receivable balance as of January  31, 2016 .  We maintainan
 allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance consists of anamount identified for sp
ecific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure.Our
 cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, including substantial amounts held outside of the United States. As of January 31,2016, we
 had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.3 billion held within the United States and $3.7 billion held outside of the United States. Mostof
 the amounts held outside the United States may be repatriated to the United States but, under current law, would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, lessapplicable foreign t
ax credits. Further, repatriation of some foreign balances may be restricted by local laws. As of January 31, 2016, we have not provided for U.S.federal
 and  state  income  taxes  on  approximately  $2.5  billion  of  undistributed  earnings  of  non-United  States  subsidiaries,  as  such  earnings  are  consideredindefinitely
 reinvested outside the United States. Although we have no current need to do so, if we repatriate foreign earnings for cash requirements in the UnitedStates,
 we would incur U.S. federal and state income tax, less applicable foreign tax credits, and reduced by the current amount of our U.S. federal and state netoperating loss
 and tax credit carryforwards. Further, in addition to the $1.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held within the United Statesand available to fund our U.S. opera
tions and any other U.S. cash needs, we have access to external sources of financing if cash is needed in the United States otherthan
 by  repatriation  of  foreign  earnings  where  U.S.  income  tax  may  otherwise  be  due.   Accordingly,  we  do  not  reasonably  expect  any  material  effect  on  ourbusiness, as a whole, or to our financ
ial flexibility with respect to our current cash balances held outside of the United States.Dividend
 payments and any share repurchases must be made from cash held in the United States. For fiscal year 2016, we made total cash dividend paymentsof 
$213 million and  repurchased $587  million of  our common stock, utilizing a significant amount of our U.S. cash balance previously taxed as of January  31,2016

Notes
On December 2, 2013, we issued $1.50 billion of 1.00% Conve

 transactions. The Notes will mature on December 1, 2018 unless earlier repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Asof
 January 31, 2016, the conversion threshold had been met and the Notes became convertible at the holders’ option beginning on February 1, 2016 and endingMay 1, 2016. As such, the 
$1.41 billion carrying value of the Notes was classified as a current liability and the $87 million difference between th e principal amountand
 the carrying value of the Notes was reclassified from shareholders’ equity to convertible debt in the mezzanine equity section of our Consolidated BalanceSheet
 as of January 31, 2016, and will remain there for as long as the Notes are convertible. The determination of whether or not the Notes are convertible mustcontinue
 to be  performed  on a quarterly  basis.  Consequently,  the Notes may be  reclassified  as long-term  debt if  the conversion  threshold  is not  met  in futurequarters.

 ended January 31, 2016. As a result, we returned  $800 million  to shareholders  during fiscal  year 2016 in the form of share repurchases  and dividendpayments.
For fiscal 2017, we intend to retu

Requ
irements 
We
 believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating, acquisition, share repurchase,cash
 dividend and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debtfinancing
 within this time frame. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our then-current shareholders. Wealso
 may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, we could be required to curtailcapital
 equipment purchases or research and development expenditures, which could harm our business. Factors that could affect our cash used or generated fromoperations and, as a result, ou
r need to seek additional borrowings or capital include: 
•
decreased demand and market acceptance for our products and/or our customers’ products;•
inability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our next-generation products;•
competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices; and•
new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors.We expect to spend approxim
ately $100 million to $150 million for capital expenditures during fiscal  year 2017, primarily for facilities, emulation equipment,computers and engineering works

Our  operating expenses for the fiscal year 2016 included $131 million of restructuring and other charges related to the wind-down of our Icera modemoperations. The $23 million r
epresents the remaining balance of the restructuring liability as of January 31, 2016.Off-Balance
Sheet
Arrangements
During fiscal
 year 2016, we began to construct a new headquarters building in Santa Clara, California, which is currently targeted for completion in the fourthquarter
 of fiscal year 2018. We are financing this construction under an off-balance sheet, build-to-suit operating lease arrangement. The banks have committed tofund up to $380 million of
 costs relating to construction. Once construction is complete, the lease balance will remain static at the completed cost for the remainingduration
 of the lease term. During construction, accrued interest will be capitalized into the lease balance. Following construction, we will pay rent in the form ofinterest.
 The lease has an initial 7.5 year term expiring on December 19, 2022, consisting of an approximately 2.5 year construction period followed by a 5 yearlease
 term. We have the option to renew this lease for up to three additional 5 year periods, subject to approval by the banks. During the term of the lease, we mayelect
 to purchase the headquarters building for the amount of the banks’ investment in the building and any accrued but unpaid rent. At the end of the lease term,we
 may elect to buy the building for the outstanding balance on the maturity date or arrange for the cash sale of the building to an unaffiliated third party. Theaggregate
 guarantee made by us under the lease is no more than 87.5% of the costs incurred in connection with the construction of the building. Please refer toNote

cing arrangement.During fiscal years 
2015 and 2014 , we had no material off-b alance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K 303(a)(4)(ii).42

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND
 QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInvestment and Interest Rate Risk
 
As of 
January 31, 2016 and January 25, 2015 , we had $5.04 billion and $4.62 billion , respectively,  in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As ofJanuary 31, 2016 
, we did not have any investments in auction-rate preferred securities.As
 of January  31, 2016 ,  we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments. According to our analysis, parallel shifts inthe yield curve of both plus or 
minus 0.5% would result in changes in fair values for these investments of $28 million . Investments
 in both fixed and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate debt securities may have their marketvalue
 adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part tothese
 factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debtor
 equity investments is judged to be other-than-temporary. We may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due tochanges
 in interest rates. However, because any debt securities we hold are classified as “available-for-sale,” no gains or losses are realized in our ConsolidatedStatements
 of Income due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in market values are determined to beother-than-temporary.
Other income and expense could also vary materially from expectations dependin
g on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments;impairment
 charges related to debt securities as well as equity and other investments; interest rates; and cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances.Volatility
 in the financial markets and economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments coulddiffer
 significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them. As of January  31, 2016 ,  our investments in government agencies and government sponsoredenterprises represented 
47% of our total investment portfolio, while the financial sector accounted for 23% of our total investment po rtfolio. Substantially all of ourinvestments
 are  with  A/A3 or  better  rated  securities.  If  the  fair  value  of  our  investments  in  these  sectors  was to  decline  by  2%  -  5%,  the fair  values  of  theseinvestments could declin
e by approximately $66 million - $164 million . On
 December  2,  2013,  we  issued $1.50  billion of  1.00  %  Convertible  Senior  Notes  due  2018,  or  the  Notes.  Please  refer  to  Note  11  of  the  Notes  to  theConsolidated
 Financial  Statements  in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional  information.  We carry the Notes at face value lessunamortized discount on our Consolid
ated Balance Sheets. Since the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changesin interest rates. However, 
the fair value of the Notes changes primarily when the market price of our stock fluctuates.During fiscal
 year 2016, we began to construct a new headquarters building in Santa Clara, California, which is currently targeted for completion in the fourthquarter
 of  fiscal  year  2018.  We  are  financing  this  construction  under  an  off-balance  sheet,  build-to-suit  operating  lease  financing  arrangement.  Followingconstruction,
 we will pay rent in the form of interest that is based on a variable interest rate and is, therefore, affected by changes in market interest rates. In orderto
 mitigate the interest rate risk on the operating lease financing arrangement, in August 2015, we entered into an interest rate swap for a portion of the operatinglease
 financing arrangement, which entitles us to pay amounts based on a fixed interest rate in exchange for receipt of amounts based on variable interest rates.Please
 refer  to Notes 9 and 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additionalinformation.
 If the syndicate of banks that are participants to the operating lease financing arrangement were to fail to fund loans for any reason, we would remainliable
 for payments due under the swap unless we were to settle the swap. If we were to settle the swap at a time when interest rates have fallen (relative to theswap’s inception), the pric
e to settle the swap could be significant.43
Table of ContentsExchange Rate Risk
 
We
 consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in“Other income, net” in our Consol
idated Financial Statements and to date have not been significant. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain (loss) includedin determining net inco
me was not significant for both fiscal year 2016 and 2015, and was a gain of $5 million for fiscal year 2014.Sales
 and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchangerate
 fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negativelyimpact
 our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising theirprices
 in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Ouroperating expenses benefi
t from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar. 
We
 may enter into certain transactions such as forward contracts which are designed to reduce the future potential impact resulting from changes in foreigncurrency exchange rat
es. There were no forward exchange contracts outstanding as of January 31, 2016 . ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATE

Our
 management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange ActRule
 13a-15(f).  Under  the  supervision  and  with  the  participation  of  our  management,  including  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  weconducted an evaluation of 
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2016 based on the criteria s et forth in Internal

.  
The

Our
 management,  including  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  does  not  expect  that  our  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  or  ourinternal
 controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,assurance
 that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and thebenefits
 of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provideabsolute assurance that 
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.

GISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Stockholders and Board of Direc
tors of NVIDIA Corporation:In
 our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial positionof
 NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries at January 31, 2016 and January 25, 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the threeyears
 in  the  period  ended  January  31,  2016  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America.  In  addition,  in  ouropinion,
 the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing  under item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth thereinwhen
 read  in  conjunction  with  the  related  consolidated  financial  statements.  Also  in  our  opinion,  the  Company  maintained,  in  all  material  respects,  effectiveinternal
 control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal 
Control
-
Integrated
Framework
(2013)  issued by theCommittee
 of Sponsoring Organizations  of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible  for these financial  statements  andfinancial
 statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control overfinancial
 reporting,  included  in  Management's  Report  on  Internal  Control  over  Financial  Reporting  appearing  under  Item  9A.  Our  responsibility  is  to  expressopinions
 on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integratedaudits. We conducted our audi
ts in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require thatwe
 plan and perform  the audits to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about whether  the financial  statements  are  free of material  misstatement  and whether  effectiveinternal control over financial reporting
 was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidencesupporting
 the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, andevaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an under
standing of internal controlover
 financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal controlbased
 on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our auditsprovide a reasonable basis 
for our opinions.As
 discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it classifies deferred tax assets and liabilities on theconsolidated balance she
et in fiscal year 2016.A
 company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation
 of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financialreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately an
d fairly reflect the transactionsand
 dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (ii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financialstatements in accordance with
 generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance withauthorizations
 of  management  and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (iii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorizedacquisition, use, or disposition o
f the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because
 of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness
 to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

- Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Our
Company
NVIDIA is
 dedicated to advancing visual computing. NVIDIA has transformed into a specialized platform company that targets four large markets - Gaming,Professional Visualization, Da
tacenter and Automotive - where visual computing is essential and valued.Our
 two reportable segments - GPU and Tegra Processor - are based on a single underlying graphics architecture. From our proprietary processors, we havecreated
 platforms that address the four large markets where our visual computing expertise is critically important. We are focused on delivering value through PC,mobile
 and cloud architectures. Our vertical integration enables us to bring together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, systems and services tocreate unique value fo
r the markets we serve.Our
 GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla for researchers and analysts focused onartificial
 intelligence, deep learning and big-data; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. We also integrate our GPUs into powerful mobile system-on-a-chip
 (SOC) processors, which drive supercomputing capabilities for tablets and online gaming and entertainment devices, as well as autonomous robots, dronesand
 cars.  Our  Tegra  brand  integrates  an  entire  computer  onto  a  single  chip,  incorporating  GPUs  and  multi-core  CPUs  with  audio,  video  and  input/outputcapabilities.
Headquartered in Santa Clar
a, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.   
All
 references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries, except where it is made clear that the termmeans only the parent comp
any.Fiscal
Year
 
We
 operate on a 52- or a 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal year 2016 was  a 53-week year with the extra week in the fiscal fourthquarter and fiscal years 
2015 and 2014 were 52-week years. Principles
of
Consolidation
 
Our
 consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  NVIDIA  Corporation  and  its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries.  All  intercompany  balances  andtransactions have been elimi
nated in consolidation.Use
of
Estimates
 
The preparation of
 financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, requires managementto
 make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of thefinancial
 statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an on-going basis,
 we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories,income
 taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. Theseestimates are based on h
istorical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.56

Revenue
Recognition
 
Product Revenue
We
 recognize  revenue  from  product  sales  when  persuasive  evidence  of  an  arrangement  exists,  the  product  has  been  delivered,  the  price  is  fixed  ordeterminable
 and  collection  of  the  related  receivable  is  reasonably  assured.  For  most  sales,  we  use  a  binding  purchase  order  and  in  certain  cases  we  use  acontractual
 agreement as evidence of an arrangement. We consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. Atthe
 point of sale, we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured. If we determine that collection of afee
 is  not  reasonably  assured,  we  defer  the  fee  and  recognize  revenue  at  the  time  collection  becomes  reasonably  assured,  which  is  generally  upon  receipt  ofpayment.
For sales to
 certain distributors with rights of return for which the level of returns cannot be reasonably estimated, our policy is to defer recognition of revenueand related cost of rev
enue until the distributors resell the product and, in some cases, when customer return rights lapse.Our
 customer programs primarily involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets. Weaccount
 for rebates as a reduction of revenue and recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date atwhich we offer the rebate. Unc
laimed rebates are reversed to revenue.Our
 customer programs also include marketing development funds, or MDFs.  MDFs represent monies paid to retailers, system builders, original equipmentmanufacturers,
 or OEMs, distributors, add-in card partners and other channel partners  that are earmarked for market  segment development  and expansion andtypically
 are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for MDFs as a reduction of revenue and apply abreakage factor to c
ertain types of MDF programs.We also
 record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarilyon
 historical return rates. However, if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales returnallowances are requir
ed to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.License and Development Revenue
For
 license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components, we generally recognize the related revenue over theperiod
 that services are performed. For most license and service arrangements, we determine progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as apercentage
 of  the  estimated  total  cost  required  to  complete  the  project.  A  provision  for  estimated  losses  on  contracts  is  made  in  the  period  in  which  the  lossbecomes
 probable and can be reasonably estimated. Costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts. Ifthe amount billed exce
eds the amount of revenue recognized, the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue.For
 license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the licenseagreement, we record reven
ue over the life of the license term, with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified as deferred revenue.Royalty
 revenue  is  recognized  related  to  the  distribution  or  sale  of  products  that  use  our  technologies  under  license  agreements  with  third  parties.   Werecognize royalty revenue 
upon receipt of a confirmation of earned royalties and when collectability is reasonably assured from the applicable licensee.57

Restructuring
and
Other
Charges
Our
 restructuring and other charges include employee severance and related costs, the write-down of assets, and other exit costs. The severance and relatedcosts
 include one-time termination benefits as well as certain statutory termination benefits or employee terminations under ongoing benefit arrangements. One-time
 termination benefits are recognized as a liability at estimated fair value when the approved plan of termination has been communicated to employees, unlessemployees must provide future service, in which case the benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period. Ongoin
g termination benefits arrangementsare
 recognized as a liability at estimated fair value when the amount of such benefits becomes estimable and payment is probable. Any contract termination costsare recognized at
 estimated fair value when we terminate the contract in accordance with the contract terms. Other associated costs are recognized in the period theliability is incurred.
Advertising
Expenses
We
 expense advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred. Advertising expenses for fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were  $ 17  million , $15million 
and $13 million , respectively. Rent
Expense
 
We recognize rent exp
ense on a straight-line basis over the lease period and accrue for rent expense incurred, but not paid. 
Product
Warranties
 
We
 generally offer limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturingdefects
 or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition.Under
 limited  circumstances,  we  may  offer  an  extended  limited  warranty  to  customers  for  certain  products.  We  also  accrue  for  known  warranty  andindemnification issues 
if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.Stock-based
Compensation
      
We
 estimate the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a binomial model and recognize the expense using a straight-line attributionmethod over
 the requisite employee service period. We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, asthe fair
 value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs, andwe
 use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-basedPSUs.
 The  compensation  expense  for  stock  options,  RSUs  and  market-based  PSUs  is  recognized  using  a  straight-line  attribution  method  over  the  requisiteemployee
 service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to beissued
 under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September ofeach year. Stock-based comp
ensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model.Litigation,
Investigation
and
Se
ttlement
CostsFrom
 time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters.However, there are many uncertainties
 associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims againstus
 will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. If that occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations couldbe
 materially and adversely affected. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations orsettlements is
 probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, theactual liability in any suc
h litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.58

Foreign
Currency
Remeasurement
 
We
 use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured intoUnited
 States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment, and equity are remeasured at historicalexchange
 rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the previouslynoted
 balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement  are included in “Otherincome, net” in our Consolidat
ed Statements of Income and to date have not been significant.The
 impact of gain or loss from foreign currency remeasurement included in determining other income, net was not significant for both fiscal year 2016 and2015, and was a gain of $ 
5 million for fiscal year 2014. Income
Taxes
 
We
 recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by taxjurisdiction.
 We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporarydifferences
 and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on availableevidence and judgment, ar
e not expected to be realized.United
 States income tax has not been provided on a portion of earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to beindefinitely reinvested.
Our
 calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application ofcomplex tax laws. Our estima
tes of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes inaccounting
 standards  or  tax  laws  in  the  United  States,  or  foreign  jurisdictions  where  we  operate,  or  changes  in  other  facts  or  circumstances.  In  addition,  werecognize
 liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxesmay be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessar
y or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required torecognize an income tax be
nefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.As
 of January 31, 2016, we had a valuation allowance of $272 million related  to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined arenot
 likely to be realized due, in part, to projections of future taxable income and potential  utilization  limitations  of tax attributes acquired as a result of stockownership changes. To
 the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income taxbenefit during the period.
We
 recognize excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation as a credit to shareholders' equity if and when realized. In determining if and whenexcess
 tax benefits have been realized, we have elected to utilize the with-and-without approach with respect to such excess tax benefits. We have also elected toignore
 the indirect tax effects of stock-based compensation deductions for financial and accounting reporting purposes, and specifically to recognize the full effectof the research tax credit in
 income from operations.We
 recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technicalmerits
 of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Please refer toNote 13 
of these Notes to the Consolidated Fin ancial Statements for additional information.Comprehensive
Income
 
Comprehensive
 income consists of net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) components include unrealizedgains (losses) on availabl
e-for-sale securities and the net change in fair value of our interest rate swap, net of tax.59
Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND
 SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONS
OLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)
Net
Income
Per
Share
 
Basic
 net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share iscomputed using the
 weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Under thetreasury
 stock method, the effect of stock options outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect isanti-dilutive.
 Additionally, we issued convertible notes with a net settlement feature that requires us, upon conversion, to settle the principal amount of debt forcash
 and the conversion premium for cash or shares of our common stock. Our convertible notes, note hedges, and related warrants contain various conversionfeatures,
 which  are  further  described  in Note  11 of  these  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  The  potentially  dilutive  shares  resulting  from  theconvertible
 notes and warrants under the treasury stock method will be included in the calculation of diluted income per share when their inclusion is dilutive.However,
 unless actually exercised, the note hedges will not be included in the calculation of diluted net income per share, as their pre-exercised effect would beanti-dilutive under th
e treasury stock method.Cash
and
Cash
Equivalents
 
We
 consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase tobe cash equivalents. As of 
January 31, 2016 and January 25, 2015 , our cash and cash equivalents we re $596 million and $497 million , respectively, including $ 43 million 
and $132 million , respectively, invested in money market funds.Marketable
Securities
 
Marketable
 securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We generally classify ourmarketable securities
 at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses includedin
 accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing securities includes accruedinterest.
 Any  unrealized  losses  which  are  considered  to  be  other-than-temporary  impairments  are  recorded  in  the  other  income  and  expense  section  of  ourConsolidated
 Statements of Income. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method andrecorded in the other in
come and expense section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.All
 of  our  available-for-sale  investments  are  subject  to  a  periodic  impairment  review.  We  record  a  charge  to  earnings  when  a  decline  in  fair  value  issignificantly
 below  cost  basis  and  judged  to  be  other-than-temporary,  or  have  other  indicators  of  impairments.  If  the  fair  value  of  an  available-for-sale  debtinstrument
 is less than its amortized cost basis, an other-than-temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where (1) we intend to sell the instrument, (2) itis
 more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) a credit loss exists where we do not expectto
 recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument. In these situations, we recognize an other-than-temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entiredifference
 between the debt instruments’ amortized cost basis and its fair value. For available-for-sale debt instruments that are considered other-than-temporarilyimpaired
 due to the existence of a credit loss, if we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the instrument beforerecovery
 of its remaining amortized cost basis (amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss), we separate the amount of the impairment into the amountthat is credit related and the
 amount due to all other factors. The credit loss component is recognized in earnings while loss related to all other factors is recorded inaccumulated other co
mprehensive income (loss).

Fair
Value
of
Financial
Instruments
 
The
 carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively shortmaturities as of 
January 31, 2016 and January 25, 2015 .  Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with therelated
 unrealized gains (losses) included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. Fair value of themarketable
 securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fairvalue.
 The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivativeinstruments
 designated as fair value hedges, the gains (losses) are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses (gains) on thehedged
 items  attributed  to  the risk  being hedged.  For derivative  instruments  designated  as cash-flow  hedges, the  effective  portion  of the  gains (losses)  on thederivatives
 is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure isrecognized in earnings.
Concentration
of
Credit
Risk
 
Financial
 instruments  that  potentially  subject  us  to  concentrations  of  credit  risk  consist  primarily  of  cash  equivalents,  marketable  securities,  accountsreceivable,
 note hedge and interest rate swap. Our investment policy requires the purchase of high grade investment securities, the diversification of asset type andincludes
 certain limits on our portfolio duration. All marketable securities are held in our name, managed by several investment managers and held by one majorfinancial
 institution under a custodial arrangement. Accounts receivable from significant customers, those representing 10% or  more of total accounts receivable,aggregated approximately 
21% of our  accounts receivable balance from one customer as of January 31, 2016 and 30% of our  account receivable balance from two customers
 as of January  25, 2015 .  We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential creditlosses.
 This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposureexcludes amounts covered by c
redit insurance and letters of credit.Accounts
Receivable
 
We
 maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Wedetermine
 this allowance, which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Factorsimpacting
 the allowance include the level of gross receivables, the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by creditinsurance or letters of credit.
Inventories
Inventory
 cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs consistprimarily
 of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs,including
 labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products andother
 component  parts.  We  charge  cost  of  sales  for  inventory  provisions  to  write  down  our  inventory  to  the  lower  of  cost  or  estimated  market  value  or  tocompletely
 write off obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products, based on our inventorylevels
 and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off orwritten-down, it creates 
a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up.Property
and
Equipment
 
Property
 and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated usefullives
 of  the  assets,  generally  three  to  five  years.  Once  an  asset  is  identified  for  retirement  or  disposition,  the  related  cost  and  accumulated  depreciation  oramortization are
 removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to twenty five years. Depreciation expense includes theamortization
 of  assets  recorded  under  capital  leases.  Leasehold  improvements  and  assets  recorded  under  capital  leases  are  amortized  over  the  shorter  of  theexpected lease term or the estimate
d useful life of the asset.61

Goodwill
Goodwill
 is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist.  For thepurposes of completing our imp
airment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis. For
 those reporting units where a significant change or event has occurred, where potential impairment indicators exist, or for which we have not performed aquantitative
 assessment recently, we utilize a two-step quantitative assessment to testing goodwill for impairment. The first step tests for possible impairment byapplying a
 fair value-based test by weighing the results from the income approach and the market approach. The second step, if necessary, measures the amount ofsuch
 impairment  by  applying  fair  value-based  tests  to  individual  assets  and  liabilities.  Please  refer  to Note  4 of  these  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  FinancialStatements for addition
al information. Intangible
Assets
Intangible
 assets primarily represent rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, acquired intellectual property, trademarks and customer relationshipsand
 are subject to an annual impairment test. We currently amortize our intangible assets with definitive lives over periods ranging from one to ten years using amethod
 that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliablydetermined, using a strai
ght-line amortization method.Impairment
of
Long-Lived
Assets
 
Long-lived
 assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes incircumstances
 indicate that the carrying amount of an asset, or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by acomparison
 of the carrying amount of an asset, or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, or asset group. Ifthe
 carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carryingamount
 of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted futurecash
 flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated BalanceSheet and the assets would be repor
ted at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.Accounting
for
Asset
Retirement
Obl
igations 
We
 account  for  asset  retirement  obligations  associated  with  the  retirement  of  tangible  long-lived  assets  and  the  associated  asset  retirement  costs.  As  ofJanuary
 31, 2016 and January 25, 2015 ,  our asset retirement obligations to return the leasehold improvements at our headquarters facility and certain laboratoriesat our domestic and inter
national facilities to their original condition upon lease termination were $2 million and $7 million , respectively. Adoption

New

Recently
Issued
Accoun
ting
PronouncementsIn
 February  2016,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board,  or  FASB,  issued  an  accounting  standards  update  regarding  the  accounting  for  leases.  Theobjective of
 the update is to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leaseswith
 a lease term of more than 12 months. In addition, the update will require additional disclosures regarding key information about leasing arrangements. Underexisting
 guidance, operating leases are not recorded as lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The update will be effective for us beginning in ourfirst
 quarter  of  fiscal  year  2020,  with  early  adoption  permitted.  We  are  currently  evaluating  the  impact  of  the  adoption  of  this  accounting  guidance  on  ourconsolidated financial
 statements, however, we expect the adoption of this accounting guidance to result in an increase in lease assets and a corresponding increasein lease liabilit
ies on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.62

In
 November 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. The new guidance requires that alldeferred
 tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The update is effective for fiscalyears
 beginning  after  December  15,  2016,  including  interim  periods  within  that  reporting  period.  Early  adoption  is  permitted  and  may  be  applied  eitherprospectively
 or  retrospectively.  We  adopted  this  update  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  year  2016  on  a  prospective  basis.  Prior  reporting  periods  were  notretrospectively adjus
ted. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our Consolidated Statements of Income.In
 July  2015,  the  FASB  issued  an  accounting  standards  update  for  the  subsequent  measurement  of  inventory.  The  amended  guidance  requires  entities  tomeasure
 inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonablypredictable
 costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The requirement would replace the current lower of cost or market evaluation. The update is effectivefor
 us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2018, with early adoption permitted to be applied prospectively. The adoption of this accounting guidance is notcurrently expected to have
 a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.In
 April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that requires an entity to present debt issuance costs on the balance sheet as a direct deductionfrom
 the related debt liability as opposed to an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. The update is effective for annualreporting
 periods  (including  interim  reporting  periods  within  those  periods)  beginning  after  December  15,  2015.  Early  adoption  is  permitted  for  financialstatements
 that have not been previously issued, and the new guidance would be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented. The update will be effectivefor
 us beginning  in our first  quarter  of fiscal  year  2017. The adoption  of this accounting  guidance  is not currently  expected  to have a material  impact  on ourconsolidated financia
l statements.In
 April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that provides clarification on whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a softwarelicense. If a software license
 is included, the customer should account for the license consistent with its accounting for other software licenses. If a software licenseis
 not included, the arrangement should be accounted for as a service contract. The update is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015,with
 early  adoption  permitted.  Companies  can  elect  to  adopt  the  standard  update  prospectively  or  retrospectively  to  arrangements  entered  into,  or  materiallymodified,
 after the effective date. The update will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2017. We expect the adoption of this accountingguidance
 to result in an increase in software license assets and related depreciation expense, and a corresponding decrease in prepaid service contract assets andrelated service contract expense
 in our consolidated financial statements.In
 May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that creates a single source of revenue guidance under U.S. GAAP for all companies, in allindustries,
 effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. On July 9, 2015, theFASB voted
 to defer the effective date by one year, such that the new standard will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The FASBwill
 also permit entities to adopt the standard one year earlier if they choose (i.e., the original effective date). We will adopt this guidance either by using a fullretrospective
 approach for all periods presented in the period of adoption or a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the impact of thisaccounting guidance on our consol
idated financial statements and have not yet determined which transition method we will apply.63

 the total fair value of equity awards, we estimated that the stock-based compensation expense related to the equity awards that are not expected to vest forfiscal years

 expected life of employee stock options is a derived output of our valuation model and is impacted by the underlying assumptions of our company. ForESPP
 shares, the expected term represents the average term from the first day of the offering period to the purchase date. The risk-free interest rate assumptionused
 to value stock options and ESPP is based upon observed interest rates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term of the award. Our expected stockprice volatility assu
mption for ESPP is estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted subsequent to November 7, 2012, we use the dividend yield at grantdate.
 Our RSU, PSU and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of RSUs, PSUs and market-basedPSUs are discounted for the dividend yi
eld.Additionally,
 for employee stock option, RSU, PSU and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture insubsequent periods
 if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience.65

Program
 
We grant stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs and stock pur
chase rights under the following equity incentive plans.Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incen
tive Plan 
In
 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, which was subsequently amended and restated in 2012, 2013 and2014, or the 2007 Plan.
The
 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock unit, stock appreciation rights,performance
 stock awards, performance  cash awards, and other stock-based  awards to employees,  directors  and consultants.  Only our employees  may receiveincentive
 stock options. Up to 187,767,766 shares  of our common stock may be issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan. Currently, we grantRSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of Janua
ry 31, 2016, there were 13,538,400 shares available for future issuance.Stock
 options previously granted to employees, subject to certain exceptions, vest over a four year period, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on the
 anniversary of the hire date in the case of new hires or the anniversary of the date of grant in the case of grants to existing employees and 6.25% vesting at the end of each quarterly pe
riod thereafter. Stock options previously granted under the 2007 Plan generally expire ten years from the date of grant.Subject
 to certain exceptions, RSUs granted to employees vest over a four year period, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting  on a pre-determineddate that is close to th
e anniversary of the date of grant and 12.5% vesting semi-annually thereafter  until fully vested.PSUs
 vest on a similar schedule as our RSUs. Market-based PSUs vest 100% on  approximately the three-year anniversary of the date of grant. However, thenumber
 of  shares  subject  to  both  PSUs  and  market-based  PSUs  that  are  eligible  to  vest  is  generally  determined  by  the  Compensation  Committee  based  onachievement of pre-determined criteria.
Unless
 terminated sooner, the 2007 Plan is scheduled to terminate on March 21, 2022. Our Board may suspend or terminate the 2007 Plan at any time. Noawards
 may be granted under the 2007 Plan while the 2007 Plan is suspended or after it is terminated. The Board may also amend the 2007 Plan at any time.However,
 if legal, regulatory or listing requirements require shareholder approval, the amendment will not go into effect until the shareholders have approved theamendment.
 
2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
 
In
 2012, our shareholders approved the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which was subsequently amended and restated in 2014, or the 2012 Plan, as thesuccessor to the 1998 Employee Stock Pur
chase Plan.Up
 to 65,235,816 shares  of our common stock may be issued pursuant to purchases under the 2012 Plan. As of January 31, 2016, we had issued 18,459,901 shares and reserved 
46,775,915 shares for future issuanc e under the 2012 Plan.The
 2012 Plan is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the current offeringsadopted pursuant to the 2012 Plan, ea
ch offering period is 24 months , which is divided into four purchas e periods of six months . Employees are eligible to participate if
 they are employed by us or an affiliate of us as designated by the Board. Employees who participate in an offering mayhave
 up to 10% of  their earnings withheld up to certain limitations and applied on specified dates determined by the Board to the purchase of shares of commonstock.
 The Board may increase this percentage at its discretion, up to 15% .  The price of common stock purchased under our ESPP will be equal to 85% of the lower
 of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each offering period and the purchase date of each offering period. Employeesmay end
 their participation in the ESPP at any time during the offering period, and participation ends automatically on termination of employment with us. In eachcase, the employee’s con
tributions are refunded.66

1.00% Convertible  Senior Notes, or the Notes, are included in the calculation of diluted net income per share if their inclusion is dilutive. The Notes willgenerally
 have a dilutive impact on net income per share if our average stock price for the reporting period exceeds the adjusted conversion price of $20.1204 per share.
 For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, our average stock price exceeded the conversion price, causing the Notes to have a dilutive impact for thisperiod.
The denominator for
 diluted net income per share does not include any effect from the convertible note hedge transaction, or the Note Hedges, that we enteredinto
 concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, as its effect would be anti-dilutive. In the event an actual conversion of any or all of the Notes occurs, the sharesthat would be delivered to us unde
r the Note Hedges are designed to neutralize the dilutive effect of the shares that we would issue under the Notes.The
 denominator for diluted net income per share will not include any effect from the warrants, which we entered into concurrently with the issuance of theNotes, unless our average stock pr
ice for the reporting period exceeds the adjusted strike price of $27.0851 per share. Please refer to Note 11 of th

 utilized a two-step quantitative analysis to complete our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 and concluded that there wasno
 impairment, as the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values. The first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair value-basedtest
 by  weighing  the  results  from  the  income  approach  and  the  market  approach.  The  second  step,  if  necessary,  measures  the  amount  of  such  impairment  byapplying fair value-bas
ed tests to individual assets and liabilities.These
 income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growthrates,
 residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions andestimates
 regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business. When performing an income approach valuation, we incorporate the useof
 projected  financial  information  and  a  discount  rate  that  are  developed  using  market  participant  based  assumptions  to  our  discounted  cash  flow  model.  Ourestimates
 of discounted cash flow were based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about our expected future operating performance, such as revenuegrowth
 rates, operating margins, risk-adjusted discount rates, and future economic and market conditions. The market method of determining the fair value of ourreporting units requires us 
to use judgment in the selection of appropriate market comparables.69

We
 performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of January  31, 2016 .  Factors considered included general market conditions, the durationand
 extent to which fair value is below cost, and our intent and ability to hold an investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in value. We alsoconsider
 specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for an investee, including industry and sector performance, changes intechnology,
 operational  and  financing  cash  flow  factors,  and  changes  in  an  investee’s  credit  rating.  Investments  that  we  identify  as  having  an  indicator  ofimpairment
 are  subject  to further  analysis to determine  if the investment  was other  than temporarily  impaired.  Based on our quarterly  impairment  review  andhaving
 considered  the  guidance  in  the  relevant  accounting  literature,  we  concluded  that  our  investments  were  appropriately  valued  and  that  no  other-than-temporary impairment charges 
were necessary on our portfolio of available-for-sale investments as of January 31, 2016 .  
As
 of January  31, 2016 ,  we had  nine investments  that were in an unrealized loss position with total unrealized losses amounting to $5  million and  with aduration
 of less than one year. The gross unrealized losses related to fixed income securities were due to changes in interest rates. We have determined that thegross

Note 7 - Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities
We
 measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value. The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quotedmarket
 prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets. Our Level 1 assets consist of our money market funds. We classifysecurities
 within Level 1 assets when the fair value is obtained from real time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets. Ouravailable-for-sale
 securities are classified as having Level 2 inputs. Our Level 2 assets are valued utilizing a market approach where the market prices of similarassets are
 provided by a variety of independent industry standard data providers to our investment custodian. We review the fair value hierarchy classification on aquarterly basis. Changes in
 the observability of valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of levels for certain securities within the fair value hierarchy. Therewere
 no significant transfers between Levels 1 and 2 assets for the year ended January  31, 2016 .  Level 3 assets are based on unobservable inputs to the valuationmethodology
 and include our own data about assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information availableunder the
 circumstances. Most of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are valued based on Level 2 inputs. We did not have any investments classified asLevel 3 as of 
January 31, 2016 .

Note 9 - Derivative Financial Instrument
In
 August 2015, we entered into an interest rate swap for a portion of the operating lease financing arrangement for our new headquarters building, whichentitles
 us to pay amounts based on a fixed interest rate in exchange for receipt of amounts based on variable interest rates. The objective of this interest rate swapis to mitigate variability in t
he benchmark interest rate on the first $200 million of existing operating lease financing payments.This
 interest rate swap, designated as a cash flow hedge, will have settlements beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, and will terminate in thefourth
 quarter of fiscal year 2023. Gains or losses on this swap are currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and will subsequently berecorded
 in earnings at the point when the related operating lease financing expense begins to affect earnings or if ineffectiveness of the swap should occur. As ofJanuary 31, 2016, accumulated oth
er comprehensive income (loss) includes a $7 million loss due to the decrease in fair value of the interest rate swap.A
 summary of the notional amount and fair value of the interest rate swap recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at  January 31, 2016  and January 25, 2015 is as follows (in millions):

Notes

2018
On
 December 2, 2013, we issued  $1.50  billion  in  Notes. The Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of the Company, which pay interest in cashsemi-annually
 at a rate of 1.00% per annum. The Notes will mature on December 1, 2018 unless repurchased or converted prior to such date. The Notes wereinitially
 convertible at a rate of  49.5958  shares  of common stock per  $1,000  principal  amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of  $20.1630  per
 share  of  common  stock).  The  conversion  rate  and  conversion  price  are  adjusted  upon  the  occurrence  of  certain  events,  including  our  cash  dividends  ordistributions
 exceeding $0.085 per  share. Accordingly, as of January 31, 2016, the initial conversion rate has been adjusted to  49.7009  shares  of common stockper
  $1,000  principal  amount of Notes (equivalent to an adjusted conversion price of  $20.1204  per  share of common stock) for dividend increases made to thatdate.
Holders
 may convert all or any portion of their Notes at their option at any time prior to August 1, 2018 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any
 fiscal quarter (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive)during
 a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of theconversion
 price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the measurement period) inwhich
 the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reportedsale
 price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after August 1,2018
 to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notesregardless of the forego
ing conditions.The
 price of our common stock was greater than or equal to 130% of  the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading daysending on the last trading day of
 our fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2016. Therefore, as of January 31, 2016, the conversion threshold had been met and the Notesbecame
 convertible at the holders’ option beginning on February 1, 2016 and ending May 1, 2016. As such, the $1.41  billion carrying  value of the Notes wasclassified as
 a current liability and the $87 million difference between  the principal amount and the carrying value of the Notes was reclassified from shareholders’equity
 to convertible debt conversion obligation in the mezzanine equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2016, and will remain therefor
 as  long  as  the  Notes  are  convertible.  The  determination  of  whether  or  not  the  Notes  are  convertible  must  continue  to  be  performed  on  a  quarterly  basis.Consequently, the
 Notes may be reclassified as long-term debt and the convertible debt conversion obligation may be reclassified within shareholders' equity if theconversion threshold is not me
t in future quarters.If
 the notes are converted, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes. We may pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock or acombination
 of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregateprincipal
 amount of the Notes being converted. Based on the  $29.29 closing  price of our common stock on January 29, 2016, the last trading day of fiscal year2016, the if-converted valu
e of our Notes exceeded their principal amount by approximately $684 million . Concurrently
 with  the  issuance  of  the  Notes,  we  entered  into  a  convertible  note  hedge  transaction,  or  the  Note  Hedges,  structured  to  offset  the  potentialcommon
 stock dilution, and/or offset potential cash payments to settle our excess conversion obligation. Cash-settled convertible debt is separated into debt andequity
 components at issuance and is assigned a fair value. The value assigned to the debt component is the estimated fair value, as of the issuance date, of asimilar
 debt without the conversion feature. The difference between the net cash proceeds and this estimated fair value, represents the value assigned to the equitycomponent
 and  is  recorded  as  a  debt  discount.  The  debt  discount  is  amortized  using  the  effective  interest  method  from  the  origination  date  through  its  statedcontractual maturity date.

The
 initial debt component of the Notes was valued at $1.35  billion based  on the contractual cash flows discounted at an appropriate market rate for a non-convertible debt
 at the date of issuance, which was determined to be 3.15% . The  carrying value of the permanent equity component reported in additional paid-in-capital was valued at  
$126 million  and recorded as a debt discoun t. This amount, together with the  $23 million  purchaser's discount to the pa r value of the Notes,represents
 the total unamortized debt discount of  $148  million  we  recorded at the time of issuance of the Notes. The aggregate debt discount is amortized asinterest
 expense  over  the  contractual  term  of  the  Notes  using  the  effective  interest  method  using  an  interest  rate  of   3.15% .  As  of  January  31,  2016,  afterreclassifying 
$87  million from  the  shareholders’  equity  section  of  our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  to  convertible  debt  conversion  obligation  in  the  mezzanineequity

The
 net proceeds from the Notes were approximately  $1.48  billion  after  payment of the initial purchaser's discount. Concurrently with the offering of theNotes,
 we entered into Note Hedges with a strike price equal to the initial conversion price of the Notes, or  $20.1630  per  share. Adjusting for dividends paidthrough January 31,
 2016, the conversion price of the Notes has been adjusted to  $20.1204  per  share. The Note Hedges allow us to receive shares of our commonstock and/or cash related to the excess conversion value that we w
ould deliver and/or pay, respectively, to the holders of the Notes upon conversion. We paid  $167 million 
 for the Note Hedges. In
 addition, concurrent with the offering of the Notes and the purchase of the Note Hedges, we entered into a separate warrant transaction, or the Warrants,with
 an initial strike price to the holders of the Warrants of  $27.1425  per  share. Under the terms of the Warrants, the strike price is adjusted upon the occurrenceof
 certain  events,  including  our  cash  dividends  or  distributions  that  deviate  from $0.085 per  share.  Accordingly,  as  of  January  31,  2016,  the  strike  price  wasadjusted
 to $27.0851 per  share,  reflecting  adjustments  for  our  dividend  increases  made  to  that  date.  The  Warrants  are  net  share  settled  and  cover,  subject  tocustomary antidilution 
adjustments,  74 million  shares of our common stock. We received  $59 million  for the Warrants transaction. The
  $108  million  net  cost of the Note Hedges offset by the proceeds from the Warrants was included as a net reduction to additional paid-in capital in theshareholders’ equity sec

Financing
Arrangement
In
 fiscal year 2016, we began to construct a new headquarters building in Santa Clara, California, which is currently targeted for completion in the fourthquarter
 of fiscal year 2018. We are financing this construction under an off-balance sheet, build-to-suit operating lease arrangement. As a part of this arrangement,we
 leased the real property we own where the building will be constructed under a 99 year ground lease to a syndicate of banks and concurrently leased back thebuilding under a real prope
rty lease.Under the
 real property lease, we pay rent, taxes, maintenance costs, utilities, insurance and other property related costs. The lease has an initial 7.5 year termexpiring
 on December 19, 2022, consisting of an approximately 2.5 year construction period followed by a 5 year lease term. We have the option to renew thislease for up to 
three additional 5 year periods, subject to approval by the banks.We
 will  oversee  the  construction  of  the  headquarters  building.  The  banks  have  committed  to  fund  up  to $380  million of  costs  relating  to  construction.Advances
 will be made periodically to reimburse us for construction costs we incur. Once construction is complete, the lease balance will remain static at thecompleted cost for the 
remaining duration of the lease term. During construction, accrued interest will be capitalized into the lease balance. Following construction,we will pay rent in the form o
f interest. We have guaranteed the obligations under the lease held by our subsidiary.During
 the term of the lease, we may elect to purchase the headquarters building for the amount of the banks’ investment in the building and any accrued butunpaid
 rent. At the end of the lease term, we may elect to buy the building for the outstanding balance on the maturity date or arrange for the cash sale of thebuilding
 to an unaffiliated third party. The aggregate guarantee made by us under the lease is no more than 87.5% of  the costs incurred in connection with theconstruction of the
 building. However, under certain default circumstances, the lease guarantee may be 100% of the banks’ investment in the building plus any andall accrued but unpaid in
terest and all other rent due and payable under the operative agreements.The
 operative agreements are subject to customary default provisions, including, for example, those relating to payment and performance defaults, and eventsof bankruptcy.
 We are also subject to financial covenants including a covenant to maintain a maximum total leverage ratio not to exceed 3.0 to 1.0 and a minimuminterest
 coverage ratio in excess of 3.5 to 1.0 during the term. If certain events of default occur and are continuing under the operative agreements, the banks mayaccelerate repayment of their investme
nt under the lease.81

On
 September 4, 2014, NVIDIA filed complaints against Qualcomm, Inc., or Qualcomm, and various Samsung entities in both the United States InternationalTrade Commission, or
 ITC, and the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging infringement of seven patents relating to graphics processing.In
 the  ITC  action,  NVIDIA  seeks  to  exclude  importation  of  Samsung  Galaxy  mobile  phones  and  tablets  and  other  consumer  electronics  and  display  devicescontaining
 Qualcomm’s Adreno, ARM’s Mali or Imagination’s PowerVR graphics architectures, or the Accused Products. On October 6, 2014, the ITC institutedan
 investigation of NVIDIA’s claim. In June 2015, NVIDIA moved to terminate all asserted claims on four patents and these motions were granted. The ITC heldan
 evidentiary hearing on certain asserted claims of the three remaining patents from June 22 through June 26, 2015. On October 9, 2015, the ITC AdministrativeLaw Judge, or ALJ, rendered an initial
 determination that importation of the Samsung Accused Products did not violate U.S. law. NVIDIA petitioned for review ofthe
 ALJ’s determination and Samsung and Qualcomm filed contingent petitions for review of the ALJ’s determination. On December 14, 2015, the ITC decidednot
 to review the ALJ’s determination and terminated the Investigation. On February 11, 2016, NVIDIA petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for theFederal Circuit to revi
ew the ITC’s decision not to review the ALJ’s determination. The petition is currently pending.In
 the Delaware action, NVIDIA seeks unspecified damages for Samsung and Qualcomm’s alleged patent infringement. On October 22, 2014, Samsung andQualcomm
 exercised their statutory right to stay the Delaware proceedings in light of the pending ITC action and the court granted the motion to stay on October23, 2014.
On
 November 10, 2014, Samsung filed a complaint against NVIDIA and Velocity Micro, Inc., in the United States District Court for the Eastern District ofVirginia,
 alleging that NVIDIA infringed six patents and falsely advertised that the Tegra K1 processor is the world’s fastest mobile processor. Samsung amendedits
 complaint twice, first on December 19, 2014, and then on April 10, 2015, without changing its legal claims. Samsung seeks monetary damages and certaininjunctive
 relief  as  to  some  of  the  asserted  patents.  NVIDIA  answered  the  second  amended  complaint  on  April  16,  2015,  and  asserted  counter-claims  againstSamsung for
 infringing four of NVIDIA’s patents and for non-infringement and invalidity of the six patents asserted in Samsung’s second amended complaint. OnApril
 24, 2015, Samsung moved to sever NVIDIA’s counter-claims for patent infringement and its motion was granted on May 19, 2015. NVIDIA voluntarilywithdrew
 its counter-claims on May 19, 2015. On June 17, 2015, Velocity Micro, Inc. voluntarily agreed to a permanent injunction regarding two of the assertedpatents
 and those patents were dismissed from the case with prejudice. Samsung’s false advertising claim was dismissed with prejudice on July 30, 2015. OnOctober
 15,  2015,  NVIDIA’s Motion  for  Entry  of  Judgment  of  Noninfringement  was  granted  as  to  one  of  Samsung’s  patents.  On January  6,  2016,  the  Courtdismissed
 plaintiff  Samsung  Electronics  America,  Inc.  due  to  lack  of  subject  matter  jurisdiction.   On  January  20,  2016,  the  Court  dismissed  with  prejudicedefendants
 Old Micro, Inc. and Velocity Holdings, LLC. On January 26, 2016, the Court dismissed with prejudice Samsung’s infringement claims as to one of thefour
 remaining patents. Beginning January 26, 2016, a jury trial was held regarding Samsung’s patent infringement claims as to the three remaining patents. OnFebruary
 1, 2016, the Court declared a mistrial as to two of the three remaining patents as a sanction based on Samsung’s failure to comply with its obligation toproduce
 all materials its experts relied on in forming the experts’ opinions in the case. The trial continued as to the last patent. On February 5, 2016, the juryreturned a
 verdict of non-infringement of that patent, that one of the four claims of that patent was invalid, and that Samsung was not entitled to any damages. There-trial of Samsung’s in
fringement claims on the two remaining patents is scheduled to begin May 4, 2016.82

On
 November  23,  2014,  Samsung  filed  a  complaint  against  NVIDIA,  among  others,  in  the  ITC  claiming  infringement  of  four  United  States  patents  andseeking
 exclusion and cease and desist orders barring importation of NVIDIA products alleged to infringe Samsung’s patents. On December 23, 2014, the ITCinstituted
 an investigation of Samsung’s claims. On June 5, 2015, Samsung withdrew one patent from the case. A hearing on Samsung’s three remaining patentswas
 held from August 18 through August 21, 2015. On December 22, 2015, the ALJ issued an Initial Determination, or ID, finding that NVIDIA and the otherRespondents
 infringed  the  asserted  claims  of  the  three  remaining  asserted  patents  and  had  violated  Section  337.  On  January  4,  2016,  NVIDIA  and  the  otherRespondents
 filed a Petition for Review of the ALJ’s ID seeking review and reversal of his findings that the asserted claims were valid and infringed and thatSection
 337 had been violated. On January 4, 2016, the Office of Unfair Import Investigations also filed a Petition for Review of the ALJ’s ID seeking review andreversal of
 his findings that the asserted claims of one of the patents were valid and infringed and that Section 337 had been violated as to that patent. On February24, 2016, the ITC determined
 to review in part the ALJ’s ID and asked for further briefing from the parties as to certain issues and patents. As the ITC did not seekto
 review the findings of infringement and validity of all three patents, the ITC may issue a limited exclusion order and a cease and desist order under one or moreof
 the patents. The innovations claimed in these patents are minor and insignificant to the performance of our products. Based on our plans to modify certainimpacted products and
 certain distribution operations in the United States, we do not believe that the possible entry of these orders will have a significant impact toour business. The target date 
for the final determination by the ITC is April 25, 2016, followed by the Presidential Review Period ending June 24, 2016.NVIDIA
 and Samsung have also challenged the validity of certain of each other’s patents through inter partes review before the United States Patent andTrademark Office.
 NVIDIA has filed eleven requests for inter partes review on eight of Samsung’s asserted patents. Samsung has filed six requests for inter partesreview
 on six patents asserted by NVIDIA, and Qualcomm has filed three additional requests for inter partes review on two patents asserted by NVIDIA. TheUnited
 States Patent and Trademark Office has, to date, decided to review four patents owned by NVIDIA, and five patents owned by Samsung. The Patent andTrademark Office has de
clined to review two patents owned by Samsung. All other requests are currently pending.On
 December  21,  2015,  Advanced  Silicon  Technologies  LLC  filed  a  complaint  in  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the  District  of  Delaware  alleginginfringement
 of four patents relating to graphics processing and memory management. Advanced Silicon Technologies seeks monetary damages. On February 22,2016,
 the Court granted NVIDIA’s unopposed motion to stay that lawsuit pending final resolution of Advanced Silicon Technologies’ parallel lawsuit in the ITC.On
 December 28, 2015, Advanced Silicon Technologies LLC filed a complaint in the ITC asserting the same four patents and seeking an exclusion order barringimportation
 of NVIDIA products alleged to infringe those patents. On January 29, 2016, the ITC instituted an investigation of Advanced Silicon Technologies’claims.
 NVIDIA responded to the ITC complaint on February 25, 2016. A hearing is scheduled for October 3 through October 7, 2016. An initial determinationfrom the ITC ALJ is due February 2, 2017, and the 
target date for the final determination by the ITC is June 2, 2017.Accounting
for
Loss
Contingencies
While
 there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe the claims made by other parties in the above ongoing matters are without merit and weintend
 to vigorously defend the actions. As of January 31, 2016, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedingsdescribed
 above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, any possible range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonablyestimated at
 this time. We are engaged in other legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of its business and, while there can be no assuranceof
 favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financialposition.

 recognized  income  tax  expense  of $129  million , $124  million and $70  million during  fiscal  years  2016,  2015,  and  2014,  respectively.  Our  annualeffective
 tax rate, was 17.3% in  fiscal year 2016, 16.5% in  fiscal year 2015 and 13.8% in  fiscal year 2014. The difference in the effective tax rates amongst thethree
 years was primarily due to an increase in the amount of earnings subject to United States tax in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, partially offset by a net incometax benefit related to the Icera m
odem restructuring in fiscal year 2016, and a higher percentage of research tax credit benefit in fiscal year 2014.Our
 effective  tax  rate  for  each  of  the  fiscal  years  was  lower  than  the  U.S.  federal  statutory  rate  of 35% due  primarily  to  income  earned  in  jurisdictions,including
 British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, where the tax rate is lower than the United States federal statutory tax rate of35% 
,  favorable  recognition  in  these  fiscal  years  of  the  U.S.  federal  research  tax  credit  and  favorable  discrete  events  primarily  attributable  to  the  tax  benefitrecognized upon the expira
tion of the applicable statutes of limitations.As of January 31, 2016 and January 25, 2015 we had a valuation allowance of 
$272 million and $261 million , respectively, related to state and certain foreigndeferred
 tax assets that management  determined  not likely to be realized  due, in part, to projections  of future taxable income. To the extent realization  of thedeferred tax assets be
comes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period.Our
 deferred tax assets do not include the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation that are a component of our federal and state net operatingloss and
 research tax credit carryforwards in the amount of $416 million as  of January 31, 2016. Consistent with prior years, the excess tax benefit reflected in ournet operating loss and rese
arch tax credit carryforwards will be accounted for as a credit to shareholders' equity, if and when realized.85

As
 of January 31, 2016, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $516 million , $664 million and $289 million , respectively. The federal
 and state carryforwards will expire beginning in fiscal year 2022 and 2017, respectively. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $275 million may be carried
 forward indefinitely and the remainder of $14 million will begin  to expire in fiscal year 2017. As of January 31, 2016, we had federal research tax creditcarryforwards of 
$476 million that will  begin to expire in fiscal year 2018. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $450 million , of which $432 million is
 attributable to the State of California and may be carried over indefinitely, and $18  million is  attributable to various other states and will expire beginning infiscal
 year 2017. We have other state tax credit carryforwards of $3 million that  will expire in fiscal year 2026 and foreign tax credit carryforwards of $1 million , which
 may be refunded in fiscal years 2017 through 2020 if not utilized. Our tax attributes, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, remain subject to auditand
 may be adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances. Utilization of federal,state,
 and foreign net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may also be subject to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided bythe Internal
 Revenue Code and similar state and foreign tax provisions. If any such limitations apply, the federal, states, or foreign net operating loss and tax creditcarryforwards, as applic
able, may expire or be denied before utilization.As
 of January 31, 2016, U.S. federal and state income taxes have not been provided on approximately $2.50  billion of  undistributed earnings of non-UnitedStates
 subsidiaries  as such earnings are considered to be indefinitely  reinvested. We have not provided the amount of unrecognized  deferred tax liabilities  fortemporary differences related to i
nvestments in our foreign subsidiaries as the determination of such amount is not practicable.As
 of January 31, 2016, we had $230  million of  gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $202  million would  affect our effective tax rate if recognized.However, approximately 
$50 million of the unrecognized tax ben efits were related to state income tax positions taken, that, if recognized, would be in the form of acarryforward deferred
 tax asset that would likely attract a full valuation allowance. The $202 million of unrecognized tax  benefits as of January 31, 2016 consistedof 
$67 million recorded in non-current income taxes payable and $135 million reflected as a reduction to t he related deferred tax assets.A reconciliation of gross unr

 is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of January 31, 2016, January 25,2015,

 tax benefits, which is not included as a component of our unrecognized tax benefits. As of January 31, 2016, non-current income taxes payable of$78 million 
consisted of unrecognized t ax benefits of $67 million and the related inte rest and penalties of $11 million . While we
 believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position.Accordingly,
 our  provisions  on  federal,  state  and  foreign  tax-related  matters  to  be  recorded  in  the  future  may  change  as  revised  estimates  are  made  or  theunderlying
 matters are settled or otherwise resolved. As of January 31, 2016, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positionswill significantly inc

Repurchase
Program
Beginning
 August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock. In May 2015, theBoard extended the previously au
thorized repurchase program through December 2018 and authorized an additional $1.62 billion under the repurchase progr am.During
 fiscal year 2016, we repurchased a total of 25 million shares for $587 million and paid $213 million in  cash dividends to our shareholders, equivalentto 
$0.085 per  share for the three months ended April 26, 2015, $0.0975 per  share for the six months ended October 25, 2015, and $ 0.115 per  share for the threemonths
 ended January 31, 2016. As a result, we returned $800  million to  shareholders during fiscal year 2016 in the form of share repurchases and dividendpayments.
Through January 31, 2016, we have repurchased 
an aggregate of 231 million shares under our share repur chase program for a total of $3.85 billion . All shares delivered
 from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. As of January 31, 2016, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchaseadditional shares of our co

- Segment Information  Our
 Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operatingsegment basis for purposes of m
aking operating decisions and assessing financial performance. Our operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments.We
 report our business in two primary reportable segments - the GPU business and the Tegra Processor business - based on a single underlying graphicsarchitecture.
Our
 GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets include GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla for researchers and analysts focused onartificial
 intelligence, deep learning and big-data; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. We also integrate our GPUs into powerful mobile system-on-a-chip
 (SOC) processors, which drive supercomputing capabilities for tablets and online gaming and entertainment devices, as well as autonomous robots, dronesand
 cars.  Our  Tegra  brand  integrates  an  entire  computer  onto  a  single  chip,  incorporating  GPUs  and  multi-core  CPUs  with  audio,  video  and  input/outputcapabilities.
We
 have a single unifying architecture for our GPU and Tegra Processors. This architecture unification leverages our visual computing expertise by chargingthe
 operating expenses of certain core engineering functions to the GPU business, while charging the Tegra Processor business for the incremental cost of theteams working directly fo
r that business. In instances where the operating expenses of certain functions benefit both reportable segments, our CODM assigns 100%of those expenses to the repor
table segment that benefits the most.The
 “All  Other”  category  presented  below  represents  the  revenue  and  expenses  that  our  CODM does  not  assign  to  either  the  GPU business  or  the  TegraProcessor business for purposes of making
 operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The revenue includes primarily patent licensing revenue and theexpenses
 include  corporate  infrastructure  and  support  costs,  stock-based  compensation  costs,  amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangible  assets,  otheracquisition-related
 costs,  product warranty  charge,  restructuring and  other  charges,  and  other  non-recurring  charges  and  benefits  that  our  CODM deems  to  beenterprise in nature.

Note 17 - Restructuring and Other Charges
 
In May 2015, we announced our intent to 
wind down our Icera modem operations and that we were open to a sale of the technology or operations. We pursuedthe sale of Icera’s technology and operations
 but were unable to identify a viable buyer with genuine interest. As a result, we began the wind-down of Icera modemoperations in the second quar
ter of fiscal year 2016.The results of
 any ongoing Icera modem operations were reported in the Tegra Processor reportable segment during fiscal year 2016 and previous fiscal years,however,
 restructuring and other charges associated with the wind-down of the Icera modem operations are separately reported with other non-recurring chargesand
 benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature. Please refer to Note 16 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussionregarding our reportabl
e segments.Our
 operating expenses for fiscal year 2016 included $131 million of  restructuring and other charges. During fiscal year 2016, we also recognized an incometax
 benefit of $49  million from  a tax reserve release upon the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations and a $27  million income  tax charge for the write-down of a deferred tax asset, bo
th of which related to our Icera modem operations.
