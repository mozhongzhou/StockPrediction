ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
Starting
 with  a  focus  on  PC  graphics,  NVIDIA  invented  the  graphics  processing  unit,  or  GPU,  to  solve  some  of  the  most  complex  problems  incomputer
 science. We have extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary  field of artificial  intelligence, or AI. Fueled by the sustaineddemand
 for better 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has evolved the GPU into a computer brain at the intersection of virtualreality, or VR, high performance computing, or HPC, and AI.
The
 GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games and films. Today, it also simulates humanintelligence,
 enabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. Its parallel processing capabilities, supported by up to thousands of computingcores, are
 essential to running deep learning algorithms. This form of AI, in which software writes itself by learning from data, can serve as the brainof
 computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered deep learning is being rapidly adopted bythousands of enterprises to deliver services and features that woul
d have been impossible with traditional coding.NVIDIA
 has a platform strategy, bringing together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, libraries, systems, and services to createunique
 value  for  the  markets  we  serve.  While  the  requirements  of  these  end  markets  are  diverse,  we  address  them  with  a  unified  underlyingarchitecture
 leveraging  our  GPUs  and  Compute  Unified  Device  Architecture,  or  CUDA,  as  the  fundamental  building  blocks.  The  programmablenature
 of our architecture allows us to support several multi-billion dollar end markets with the same underlying technology by using a variety ofsoftware
 stacks developed either internally or by third party developers and partners. The large and growing number of developers for each of ourplatforms strengthens our ecosystem and increases the value of our platform to our customers.
Innovation
 is at our core. We have invested over $15 billion in research and development since our inception, yielding inventions that are essentialto
 modern  computing.  Our  invention  of  the  GPU  in  1999  defined  modern  computer  graphics  and  established  NVIDIA  as  the  leader  in  visualcomputing.
 With our introduction of the CUDA programming model in 2006, we opened the parallel processing capabilities of the GPU for generalpurpose
 computing.  This  approach  significantly  accelerates  the  performance  of  the  most  demanding  applications  in  HPC  in  fields  such  asaerospac
e, bio-science research, mechanical and fluid simulations, and energy exploration. Today, GPUs power the fastest supercomputers acrossthe
 world. In addition, the massively parallel compute architecture of our GPUs and associated software have proven to be well suited for deeplearning, an approach we bel
ieve will power the era of AI. As the laws of physics have begun to slow down Moore’s Law, we continue to deliver GPUperformance improvements ahead of Moore’s Law, giving the in
dustry a path forward.Gamers
 choose  NVIDIA  GPUs  to  enjoy  immersive,  increasingly  cinematic  virtual  worlds.  GPUs  also  help  underpin  the  world’s  fastest  growingspectator
 sport, eSports, which attracts  hundreds of millions of viewers to watch top-quality gaming. More than 100 million people participate inMOBA - multiplayer online battle area - games, which are powered by GPUs.
Researchers
 use our GPUs to accelerate a wide range of important applications, from simulating viruses to exploring the origins of the universe.With
 support for more than 500 applications - including the top 15 HPC applications - NVIDIA GPUs enable some of the most promising areas ofdiscovery,
 from weather prediction to materials science and from wind tunnel simulation to genomics. In 2017, NVIDIA’s GPU computing supportedthe Nobel Prize-winning disc
overies in physics and chemistry.The world’s
 leading cloud service providers use our GPUs to enable, accelerate or enrich the services they deliver to billions of end-users, includingsearch, social networking, online sho
pping, live video, translation, AI assistants, navigation, and cloud computing.A
 rapidly growing number of enterprises and startups use our GPUs to facilitate deep learning that meets, and in several cases surpasses, humanperception,
 in fields ranging from radiology to precision agriculture. For example, the transportation industry is turning to our GPUs and AI to enableautonomous vehicles, or AVs, with more than 320 compani
es and organizations working with NVIDIA’s DRIVE platform.Professional designers use our GPUs to create visual effects in movies a
nd design products ranging from soft drink bottles to commercial aircraft.While
 our GPU and CUDA architecture is unified, our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadrofor
 designers; Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brandintegrates an entire computer onto a single chip, and i

 leadership in AI and building on its long-standing automotive relationships, we are delivering a full solution for the AV market under theDRIVE
 brand.  NVIDIA  has  demonstrated  multiple  applications  of  AI  within  the  car.  AI  can  drive  the  car  itself  as  a  pilot,  in  either  partial  or  fullyautonomous mode. AI can also be a co-pilot, assisting the huma
n driver in creating a safer driving experience.NVIDIA
 is working with over 320 automakers, tier-one suppliers, automotive research institutions, HD mapping companies, and startups to developand
 deploy AI systems for self-driving vehicles. Our unified AI computing architecture starts with mapping and training deep neural networks usingour
 Tesla GPUs, and then running them within the vehicle on the NVIDIA DRIVE AI car computing platform. This end-to-end approach leveragesNVIDIA DriveWorks software and allows cars to receive over-the-air updates to add ne
w features and capabilities throughout the life of a vehicle.DRIVE
 PX can understand in real-time what's happening around the vehicle, precisely locate itself on an HD map, and plan a safe path forward.This
 advanced self-driving car platform combines deep learning, sensor fusion, and surround vision to change the driving experience. Our DRIVEPX platform
 scales from a palm-sized, energy-efficient module for AutoCruise automated highway-driving capabilities to a configuration with multiplesystems
 aimed at enabling driverless cars. A new single-processor configuration of DRIVE PX enables vehicles to use deep neural networks toprocess data from multiple cameras and sensors.
Business Strategies
NVIDIA’s key strategies that shape our overall business a
pproach include:Advancing
 the  GPU  computing  platform. The  massive  parallel  processing  capabilities  of  NVIDIA  GPUs  can  solve  complex  problems  insignificantly
 less time and with lower power consumption than alternative computational approaches. Indeed, GPUs can help solve problems thatwere
 previously  deemed  unsolvable.  We  work  to  deliver  continued  GPU  performance  leaps  that  outpace  Moore’s  Law  by  leveraging  innovationacross
 the  architecture,  chip  design,  system,  and  software  layers.  Our  strategy  is  to  target  markets  where  GPUs  deliver  order-of-magnitudeperformance
 advantages  relative  to  legacy  approaches.  Our  target  markets  so  far  include  gaming,  professional  visualization,  datacenter,  andautomotive.
 While the requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUsand
 CUDA as the fundamental building blocks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to make leveraged investments in R&D: wecan
 support  several multi-billion  dollar end markets  with the same underlying technology  by using a variety of software  stacks  developed eitherinternally or by third party developers and partners. We utilize this platform approac
h in each of our target markets.Extending our technology and platform leadership in AI. 
Deep learning is fundamental to the evo lution of AI. We provide a complete, end-to-endGPU
 computing  platform  for  deep  learning,  addressing  both  training  and  inferencing.  This  includes  GPUs,  our  CUDA  programming  language,algorithms,

latforms.Extending
 our technology and platform leadership in visual computing. We  believe  that  visual  computing  is  fundamental  to  the  continuedexpansi
on and evolution of computing. We apply our research and development resources to extending our leadership in visual computing, enablingus
 to enhance the user experience  for consumer  entertainment  and professional visualization  applications.  Our technologies  are instrumental  indriving
 gaming forward, as developers leverage our libraries and algorithms to create near-cinematic and VR experiences. Our close collaborationwith
 game developers allows us to deliver an optimized gaming experience on our GeForce platform. Our GeForce Experience gaming applicationfurther
 enhances each gamer’s experience by optimizing their PC’s settings, as well as enabling the recording and sharing of gameplay. We alsoenable
 interactive graphics applications - such as games, movie and photo editing and design software - to be accessed by almost any device,almost anywhere, through our cloud platforms such as GRID for enterprise and GeForce NOW for gaming.
Advancing the leading autonomous vehicle platform. 
We believe the advent of AV will soon revol utionize the transportation industry. In our view,AI
 is  the  key  technology  enabler  of  this  opportunity,  as  the  algorithms  required  for  autonomous  driving  -  such  as  perception,  localization,  andplanning
 -  are  too  complex  for  legacy  hand-coded  approaches,  and  will  run  on  multiple  trained  neural  networks  instead.  Therefore,  we  haveprovided a full functionally safe AI-based hardware and sof
tware solution for the AV market under the DRIVE brand, which we are bringing to marketthrough
 our partnerships with automotive original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, tier-1 suppliers, and start-ups. Our AV solution also includesthe
 GPU-based hardware required to train the neural networks before their in-vehicle deployment, as well as to re-simulate their operation prior toany
 over-the-air software updates. We believe our comprehensive, top-to-bottom and end-to-end approach will enable the transportation industry tosolve the complex problems arising from the shift to autonomous driving.
Leveraging our intellectual property. 
We believe our  intellectual property is a valuable asset that can be accessed by our customers and partnersthrough licenses
 and development agreements when they desire to build such capabilities directly into their own products, or have us do so througha custom development. Such license and dev
elopment arrangements can further enhance the reach of our technology.Sales and Marketing
Our
 sales strategy involves working with end customers and various industry ecosystems through our partner network. Our worldwide sales andmarketing
 strategy is key to achieving our objective of providing markets with our high-performance and efficient GPU and embedded system-on-a-chip,
 or SOC, platforms. Our sales and marketing teams, located across our global markets, work closely with end customers in each industry. Ourpartner
 network  incorporates  each  industry's  respective  OEMs,  original  device  manufacturers,  or  ODMs,  system  builders,  add-in  boardmanufacturers,
 or  AIBs,  retailers/distributors,  internet  and  cloud  service  providers,  automotive  manufacturers  and  tier-1  automotive  suppliers,mapping companies, start-ups, and other ecosystem participants.
Members of
 our sales team have technical expertise and product and industry knowledge. We also employ a team of application engineers to assistour
 partner network in designing, testing, and qualifying system designs that incorporate our platforms. We believe that the depth and quality of ourdesign
 support  are  key  to  improving  our  partner  network’s  time-to-market,  maintaining  a  high  level  of  customer  satisfaction,  and  fosteringrelationships that encourage our end customers an
d partner network to use the next generation of our products within each platform.To
 encourage  the  development  of  applications  optimized  for  our  GPUs,  we  seek  to  establish  and  maintain  strong  relationships  in  the  softwaredevelopment
 community. Engineering and marketing personnel engage with key software developers to promote and discuss our platforms, as wellas
 to ascertain individual product requirements and solve technical problems. Our developer program makes our products available to developersprior
 to  launch  in  order  to  encourage  the  development  of  AI  frameworks,  SDKs,  and  APIs  for  software  applications  and  game  titles  that  areoptimized for our platforms. Our
 Deep Learning Institute provides in-person and online training for developers in industries and organizations aroundthe
 world to build AI and accelerated computing applications that leverage our GPU and CUDA platforms. We now have over 700,000 registereddevelopers across our platforms, including accel
erated computing, gaming, deep learning, autonomous machines, and others.As
 NVIDIA’s  business  has  evolved  from  a  focus  primarily  on  gaming  products  to  broader  markets,  and  from  chips  to  platforms  and  completesystems,
 so, too, have our avenues to market. Thus, in addition to sales to customers in our partner network, certain of our platforms are also soldthrough e-tail channels, or direct to cloud service providers an
d enterprise customers.Backlog
Our
 sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders. The quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipmentschedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in b
oth the customers' requirements and8

 manufacturing availability. Our industry is characterized by relatively short lead time orders and delivery schedules, thus, we believe that only asmall portion of our backlog is non-cancela
ble and that the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable portion is not significant.Seasonality
Our
 GPU  and  Tegra  processor  platforms  serve  many  markets  from  consumer  PC  gaming  to  enterprise  workstations  to  government  and  cloudservice
 provider datacenters, although a majority of our revenue stems from the consumer industry. Our consumer products have typically seenstronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. However, there can be no ass
urance that this trend will continue.Manufacturing
We
 do not directly manufacture semiconductors used for our products. Instead, we utilize a fabless manufacturing strategy, whereby we employworld-class
 suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. This strategy usesthe
 expertise  of  industry-leading  suppliers  that  are  certified  by  the  International  Organization  for  Standardization  in  such  areas  as  fabrication,assembly,
 quality control and assurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated withowning and operating manufacturi
ng operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products, such assubstrates
 and a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of the majority of the raw materials used in the production ofour products. As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, addition
al quality assurance, marketing, and customer support.We utilize industry-leadi
ng suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, to produceour
 semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., BYD Auto Co. Ltd.,Hon
 Hai  Precision  Industry  Co.,  Ltd.,  JSI  Logistics  Ltd.,  King  Yuan  Electronics  Co.,  Ltd.,  and  Siliconware  Precision  Industries  Company  Ltd.  toperform
 assembly, testing, and packaging of most of our products and platforms. We purchase substrates from IbidenCo. Ltd., Nanya TechnologyCorporation, and Unimicron Technol
ogy Corporation, and memory from Micron Technology, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., and SK Hynix.We
 typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance, and then ship the semiconductors tocontract equipment manufactur
ers, or CEMs, distributors, motherboard and AIB customers from our third-party warehouse in Hong Kong. Generally,these
 manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications, and then ship our products to retailers, systembuilders, or OEMs as motherboard and AIB solutions.
We
 also utilize industry-leading contract manufacturers, or CMs, such as BYD and Quanta Computer, to manufacture some of our products for saledirectly
 to  end  customers.  In  those  cases,  key  elements  such  as  the  GPU,  SOC  and  memory  are  often  consigned  by  us  to  the  CMs,  who  areresponsible for the procurement of other components used in the producti
on process.Working Capital
We
 focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other working-capital-related items. We manage inventories by communicatingwith
 our  customers  and  partners  and  then  using  our  industry  experience  to  forecast  demand  on  a  platform-by-platform  basis.  We  then  placemanufacturi
ng orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand. We generally maintain substantial inventories of our products becausethe
 semiconductor  industry  is  characterized  by  short  lead  time  orders  and  quick  delivery  schedules.  A  substantial  amount  of  our  inventories  ismaintained as semi-finished products that can be lev
eraged across a wide range of our processors to balance our customer demands.Our existing cash and marketable securities balances increas
ed by 5% to $7.11 billion at the  end of fiscal year 2018 compared with the end of fiscal year 
2017 . Research and Development
We believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leadin
g accelerated computing technology is essentialto
 our future success. Our research and development strategy is focused on a unified hardware and software architecture. Our products take yearsto
 design and bring to market, and we concurrently develop multiple generations of our architecture. Our research and development efforts includesoftware
 engineering,  including  efforts  related  to  the  development  of  our  CUDA  platform,  hardware  engineering  related  to  our  GPUs,  Tegraprocessors, and systems, very large scale integration design eng
ineering, process engineering, architecture and algorithms.9
Table of ContentsAs
 of January  28, 2018 ,  we had 8,191 full-time  employees engaged in research and development. During fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , we incurred research and development expe
nses of $1.80 billion , $1.46 billion , and $ 1.33 billion , respectively. Competition
The market for
 our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. We believethat
 the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distributionchannels,
 software support, conformity to industry standard Application Programming Interfaces, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, andtotal system costs.
 We believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions thatcustomers
 and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and atcompetitiv
e prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costlythan
 ours, or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors oralliances among competitors could emerge a
nd acquire significant market share.A
 significant  source  of  competition  comes  from  companies  that  provide  or  intend  to  provide  GPUs,  embedded  SOCs,  and  accelerated  and  AIcomputing processor products. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distributio
n and manufacturing resources than we doand may be more able to adapt to customer or technological chan
ges.Our current competitors include:
•
suppliers or licensors of discrete and integrated GPUs and accelerated computing solutions, including chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics,or
 HPC  or  accelerated  computing  functionality  as  part  of  their  solutions  or  platforms,  such  as  Advanced  Micro  Devices,  or  AMD,  ARMHoldings plc, Imagination Techn
ologies Group plc, Intel Corporation, or Intel, and Xilinx, Inc.; and•
suppliers of SOC products that are embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and smart devices such as televisions, monitors, set-top
 boxes,  and  gaming  devices,  such  as  Ambarella,  Inc.,  AMD,  Broadcom  Ltd.,  Intel,  Qualcomm  Incorporated,  Renesas  ElectronicsCorporation, Samsung, and Texas Instruments Incorporated.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
We
 rely  primarily  on  a  combination  of  patents,  trademarks,  trade  secrets,  employee  and  third-party  nondisclosure  agreements,  and  licensingarrangements
 to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents have expiration dates fromApril
 2018 to January 2037. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patentsand
 pending  patent  applications  primarily  relate  to  our  products  and  the  technology  used  in  connection  with  our  products.  We  also  rely  oninternational
 treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our productsare
 or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the sameextent
 as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. Wecontinuously assess whether and wh
ere to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:•
the location in which our products are manufactured;•
our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;•
the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and•
the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and regions.We
 have also licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in some of our products and for defensive reasons, and expect to continue toenter into such license agreements.
Employees
As of 
January 28, 2018 , we had 11,528 employees, 8,191 of  whom were engaged in research and development and 3,337 of whom were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative positi
ons.Environmental Regulatory Compliance

If
 we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets, or identify new products, services or technologies, our revenue and financial resultsmay be adversely impacted.
We
 have  created  GPU-based  visual  and  accelerated  computing  platforms  that  address  four  large  markets:  Gaming,  Professional  Visualization,Datacenter,
 and  Automotive.  These  markets  often  experience  rapid  technological  change,  changes  in  customer  requirements,  new  productintroductions
 and enhancements, and evolving industry standards. Our success depends on our ability to identify these emerging industry changesand
 to develop new (or enhance our existing) products, services and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets. Such activitiesmay
 require  considerable  technical,  financial,  compliance,  sales  and  marketing  investments.  We  currently  devote  significant  resources  to  thedevelopment
 of technologies and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history, such as the automotive and datacentermarkets,
 which presents additional risks to our business. We must also continue to develop the infrastructure needed to appropriately scale ourbusiness
 in these areas, including customer service and customer support. We also must meet customer safety and compliance standards, whichare
 subject to change. Additionally, we continue to make considerable investments in research and development, which may not produce significantrevenue
 for several years, if at all. If our investments are unsuccessful and we fail to develop new products, services and technologies, or if wefocus
 on technologies that do not become widely adopted, our business, revenue, financial condition and results of operations could be adverselyaffected.
 We cannot assure you that our strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers,partners
 and ultimately, our shareholders. If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends, or if wedo
 not appropriately adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve, in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities, our business willbe harmed.
Competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue.
Our
 target markets remain extremely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product and/or serviceofferings,
 industry  standards  continue  to  evolve,  customer  needs  change  and  new  competitors  enter  these  markets.  Our  competitors’  products,services and
 technologies may be less costly, or may offer superior functionality or better features, than ours, which may result, among other things,in lower
 than expected selling prices for our products. In addition, some of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities, havelonger
 operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive intellectual property, or IP, portfolios and patent protections, and greaterfinancial,
 sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize uponopportunities
 in  new  markets  and  end  user  customer  trends,  quickly  transition  their  products,  including  semiconductor  products,  to  increasinglysmaller
 line width geometries, and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials, which could harm our business. If we are unable tosuccessfully
 compete  in  our  target  markets,  respond  to  changes  in  our  target  markets  or  introduce  new  offerings  to  meet  the  needs  of  thiscompetitive
 environment, including in significant international markets such as China, demand for our products, services and technologies coulddecrease,
 which would cause our revenue to decline and cause our results of operations to suffer. In addition, the competitive landscape in ourtarget
 markets has changed and may continue to evolve due to a trend toward consolidation, which could lead to fewer customers, partners, orsuppliers, any of which could negativ
ely affect our financial results.12
Table of ContentsSystem
 security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue andincrease our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation.
Security
 breaches,  computer  malware  and  cyber-attacks  have  become  more  prevalent  and  sophisticated  in  recent  years.  These  threats  areconstantly
 evolving,  making  it  increasingly  difficult  to  successfully  defend  against  them  or  implement  adequate  preventative  measures.  Theseattacks
 have  occurred  on  our  systems  in  the  past  and  are  expected  to  occur  in  the  future.  Experienced  computer  programmers,  hackers  andemployees
 may penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information, or that of our employees or thirdparties.
 These attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These hackers may also develop and deploy viruses, worms and othermalicious
 software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products, including consumer and automotive products,where
 we utilize over-the-air updates to improve functionality over time. For portions of our IT infrastructure, including business management andcommunication
 software products, we rely on products and services provided by third parties. These providers may also experience breaches andattacks
 to their products which may impact our systems. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, such as actions by anemployee
 with  access  to  our  systems.  To  defend  against  security  threats,  both  to  our  internal  systems  and  those  of  our  customers,  we  mustcontinuously engineer more secure prod
ucts and enhance security and reliability features, which may result in increased expenses.Actual
 or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietaryinformation
 or sensitive or confidential data about us, our partners, our customers or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to a riskof
 loss or misuse of this information,  resulting  in litigation  and potential  liability,  paying damages,  regulatory  inquiries or actions,  damage to ourbrand
 and reputation or other harm to our business. Our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and maynot
 be successful. We may experience interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. Such disruptions couldadversely
 impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of thesedisruptions could adversely affect our financia
l results, stock price and reputation.If
 our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects, our reputation could bedamaged, and we could lose market share.
Our
 products  are  complex  and  may  contain  defects  or  security  vulnerabilities,  or  experience  failures  or  unsatisfactory  performance  due  to  anynumber
 of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. These risks may increase as our products are introducedinto new
 devices, markets, technologies and applications, including into the automotive market, or as new versions are released. Some errors in ourproducts
 or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used by customers or the end users of such product.Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose
 our customers or end users to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties whodevelop
 and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. Failure of our products toperform to specifications, or other
 product defects, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers, the end product inwhich our
 device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defectmay
 cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs, write off the value of related inventory, cause us to lose marketshare,
 and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. In addition, an erroror
 defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achievemarket acceptance or loss
 of design wins, harm our relationships with customers and partners and harm consumers’ perceptions of our brand. Also,we
 may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including costs to repair or replace products in the field. A product recall,including
 automotive recalls or a recall due to a bug in our products, or a significant number of product returns could be expensive, damage ourreputation,
 harm our ability to attract new customers, result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us, such asproduct liability
 suits. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the effortsof our
 technical and management personnel, and harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coveragemay be unavailable on accepta
ble terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.We
 depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test and/or package our products, which reduces our controlover
 product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm ourbusiness.
We
 do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our GPUs and Tegra processors and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. Instead,we
 are dependent on industry-leading foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co.Ltd.,
 to  manufacture  our  semiconductor  wafers  using  their  fabrication  equipment  and  techniques.  Similarly,  we  do  not  directly  assemble,  test  orpackage our products, but instead rely on
13
Table of Contentsindependent
 subcontractors. We do not have long-term commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors. As a result, we face severalsignificant risks which could have an adverse
 effect on our ability to meet customer demand and/or negatively impact our business operations, grossmargin, revenue and/or financial results, includ
ing:•
a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices due to supply constraints;•
a failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate or any manufacturing or test capacity for our products;•
a  failure  to  develop,  obtain  or  successfully  implement  high  quality,  leading-edge  process  technologies,  including  transitions  to  smallergeometry
 process technologies such as 16nm FinFET, and memory designs such as CoWoS, needed to manufacture our products profitablyor on a timely basis;
•
loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencingvolume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or cha
nge a supplier;•
a lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality; and•
delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundriesprioritize our competitors’ orders over our orders or otherwise.
In
 addition, low manufacturing yields could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand, increase manufacturing costs, harmcustomer
 or partner relationships, and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. Manufacturingyields
 for our products are a function of product design, which is developed largely by us, and process technology, which typically is proprietary tothe
 foundry. Low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure. We do not know whether a yield problem will exist untilour
 design is actually manufactured by the foundry. As a result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process andrequire us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem.
We
 also  rely  on  third-party  software  development  tools  to  assist  us  in  the  design,  simulation  and  verification  of  new  products  or  productenhancements,
 and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner. In the past, we have experienced delays in theintroduction
 of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complexfeatures
 and  functionalities  of  our  products.  The  design  requirements  necessary  to  meet  consumer  demands  for  more  features  and  greaterfunctionality
 from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. If we miss design cycles or lose design winsdue to the unavailability of such software deve
lopment tools, we could lose market share and our revenues could decline.If we fail to achieve design wins for our products, our business wil
l be harmed.For
 our products that we do not sell directly to consumers, achieving design wins is an important success factor. Achieving design wins may involvea
 lengthy  process  in  pursuit  of  a  customer  opportunity  and  depend  on  our  ability  to  anticipate  features  and  functionality  that  customers  andconsumers
 will  demand.  Failure  to  obtain  a  particular  design  win  may  prevent  us  from  obtaining  design  wins  in  subsequent  generations  of  aparticular product. This could result in lost revenue and co
uld weaken our position in future competitive bid selection processes.Unantici
pated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers andsoftware
 developers. Further, if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards, including safety standards, our customersmay
 not incorporate our products into their design strategies.  Winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we willrealize as much revenue as anticipated, if any.
Business disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs.
Our
 worldwide  operations  could  be  disrupted  by  earthquakes,  telecommunications  failures,  power  or  water  shortages,  outages  at  cloud  serviceproviders,
 tsunamis,  floods,  hurricanes,  typhoons,  fires,  extreme  weather  conditions,  cyber-attacks,  terrorist  attacks,  medical  epidemics  orpandemic
s and other natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic events or climate change. The occurrence of any of these disruptions could harmour
 business and result in significant losses, a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses. Any of these business disruptionscould
 require  substantial  expenditures  and  recovery  time  in  order  to  fully  resume  operations.  Our  corporate  headquarters,  and  a  portion  of  ourresearch
 and development activities, are located in California, and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in Asia,near
 major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. In addition, a majority of our current datacenter capacity is located in California, making ouroperations
 vulnerable  to  natural  disasters  or  other  business  disruptions  occurring  in  these  geographical  areas.  The  manufacture  of  productcomponents,
 the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan,China
 and  Korea.  Geopolitical  change  or  changes  in  government  regulations  and  policies  in  the  U.S.  or  abroad  also  may  result  in  changingregulatory requirements,

 policies, and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. Catastrophicevents
 can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systemsand
 personnel.  Our  operations  could  be  harmed  if  manufacturing,  logistics  or  other  operations  in  these  locations  are  disrupted  for  any  reason,including
 natural  disasters,  high  heat  events  or  water  shortages,  information  technology  system  failures,  military  actions  or  economic,  business,labor,
 environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers and ourgeneral infrastructur
e of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event amajor
 earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affects us or the third-party systems on which we rely, our business could be harmed as aresult of declines in revenue, increases in exp
enses, substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations.If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed.
We
 manufacture our GPUs and Tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand and requirements. In order to have shorter shipmentlead
 times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, or maybuild inventory anticipating demand for
 a product that does not materialize. In estimating demand, we make multiple assumptions, any of which mayprove to be incorrect. Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory inclu
de:•
changes in business and economic conditions, including downturns in our target markets and/or overall economy;•
changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit market;•
a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products;•
a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;•
our introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products;•
less demand than expected for newly-introduced products; or•
increased competition, including competitive pricing actions.The
 cancellation  or  deferral  of  customer  purchase  orders  could  result  in  our  holding  excess  inventory,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  grossmargins. In
 addition, because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter, we may not be able to reduce ourinventory
 purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals. We could be required to write-down ourinventory
 to the lower of cost or market or write-off excess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectlyforecast product demand, any of which could harm our financial resu
lts.Conversely,
 if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity toincrease
 production  and  we  may  not  be  able  to  obtain  sufficient  inventory  to  fill  customers'  orders  on  a  timely  basis.  We  may  also  face  supplyconstraints
 caused by natural disasters or other events. In such cases, even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand,we
 may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner. If we fail to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customerrelationships could be damag
ed, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged.We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations, which may harm our business.
We
 conduct  our  business  worldwide  and  we  have  offices  in  various  countries  outside  of  the  United  States.  Our  semiconductor  wafers  aremanufactured,
 assembled,  tested  and  packaged  by  third  parties  located  outside  of  the  United  States  and  Other  Americas.  We  also  generate  asignificant
 portion of our revenue from sales outside the United States and Other Americas. Revenue from sales outside of the United States andOther
 Americas accounted for  79% ,  80%, and 79% of total revenue for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Additionally, as of January28,
 2018,  approximately  47%  of  our  employees  were  located  outside  of  the  United  States.  The  global  nature  of  our  business  subjects  us  to  anumber
 of  risks  and  uncertainties,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations,including:
•
international economic and political conditions, such as political tensions between countries in which we do business;•
unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including changes in tax laws;•
differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices;•
local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibitedfrom engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anticorrupti
on laws and regulations;•
exporting  or  importing  issues  related  to  export  or  import  restrictions,  including  deemed  export  restrictions,  tariffs,  quotas  and  other  tradebarriers and restrictions;

disruptions of capital and trading markets and currency fluctuations; and•
increased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations, such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and pollution limits.If
 our sales outside of the United States and Other Americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may benegatively impacted.
If
 we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, we may not be able to execute our business strategyeffectively.
To
 be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees. Themarket
 for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. In particular, hiring qualified executives, scientists, engineers,technical
 staff and research and development personnel is critical to our business. Additionally, changes in immigration and work permit laws andregulations
 or the administration or interpretation of such laws or regulations could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees.If
 we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products andservices
 may  be  adversely  affected.  Additionally,  competition  for  personnel  results  in  increased  costs  in  the  form  of  cash  and  stock-basedcompensation. The
 interpretation and application of employment related laws to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs andless
 flexibility in how we meet our workforce  needs. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensureeffective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involvi
ng key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.We
 may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments and we maynot
 be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sellour products.
We
 have  in  the  past  acquired  and  invested  in,  and  may  continue  to  acquire  and  invest  in,  other  businesses  that  offer  products,  services  andtechnologies
 that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products, strategic objectives and business. The risks associated with past orfuture acquisiti
ons or investments could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products, and ultimately could havea
 negative impact on our growth or our financial results. Given that our resources are limited, our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunitycosts;
 accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help usachieve our strategic objectives. Addition
al risks related to acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:•
difficulty in combining the technology, products, operations or workforce of the acquired business with our business;•
diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention;•
assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;•
difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return, if at all;•
difficulty in obtaining regulatory, other approvals or financing;•
failure and costs associated with the failure to consummate a proposed acquisition or other strategic investment;•
legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;•
uncertainties and time needed to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;•
the need to later divest acquired assets if an acquisition does not meet our expectations;•
potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the acquired assets or company; and•
impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s, employees, vendors and customers, as a result of our acquisition or investment.Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Common Stock and Other Matters
Actions
 to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we areunsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our
 products.We
 have in the past, currently are, and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement orother
 intellectual property rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement. Anunfavorable
 ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages, invalidation of a patent or family of patents,indemnification
 of customers, payment of lost profits, or, when it has been sought, injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringethe IP rights of others,
16
Table of Contentsregardless
 of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert theefforts and attention of management and technical personn
el.We
 may  commence  litigation  or  other  legal  proceedings  in  order  to  protect  our  intellectual  property  rights.  Such  proceedings  may  increase  ouroperating
 expenses, which could negatively impact our operating results. Further, we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation oflitigation.
 If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s patent or intellectual property, we or one ofour
 indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s patent or other intellectual property rights. However, we may not be able to obtainlicenses
 at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from athird
 party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend ordiscontinue
 the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments, or cross license ourtechnology.
 If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore,the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our op
erating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results.Our
 success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks,trade
 secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements, and the laws of the countries in which we operate toprotect
 our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protectour
 intellectual property rights, and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights that are valuableto
 our business. The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws ofthe
 United  States.  This  makes  the  possibility  of  piracy  of  our  technology  and  products  more  likely.  In  addition,  the  theft  or  unauthorized  use  orpublication
 of  our  trade  secrets  and  other  confidential  business  information  could  harm  our  competitive  position  and  reduce  acceptance  of  ourproducts;
 as  a  result,  the  value  of  our  investment  in  research  and  development,  product  development,  and  marketing  could  be  reduced.  Wecontinuously
 assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies, but cannot be certain whetherour applications for such protections will be a
pproved, and, if approved, whether we will be able to enforce such protections.Our
 operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectationsof securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.
Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate d
ue to numerous factors. Therefore, investors should notrely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indicati
on of our future performance.Factors, other than those described elsewhere in these risk factors, that could affect our results of operations in the future incl
ude, but are not limitedto:
•
our ability to achieve volume production of our next-generation products;•
our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;•
fluctuations in the demand for our products related to cryptocurrencies;•
changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our partners’ products;•
our ability to cover the manufacturing and design costs of our products through competitive pricing;•
our ability to comply and continue to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations;•
product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues;•
our ability to secure appropriate safety certifications and meet industry safety standards;•
supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our products•
inventory write-downs;•
our ability to continue generating revenue from our partner network, including by generating sales within our partner network and ensuring ourproducts
 are incorporated into our partners product ecosystems, and our partner network’s ability to sell products that incorporate our GPUsand Tegra processors;
•
the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments to us, and our ability to obtain credit insurance over the purchasing creditextended to these customers;
•
customer bad debt write-offs;•
any unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities;•
unexpected costs related to our ownership of real property;17
Table of Contents•
changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards; and•
general macroeconomic or industry events and factors affecting the overall market and our target markets.Any
 one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results. Any such failure to meet ourexpectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could caus
e our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility.Privacy
 concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter current and potential users from using ourproducts and services, result in liability, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings.
Our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidentia
l or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and securitylaws
 and regulations. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information orother
 privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss, or misuseof
 personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business or by one of our partners could result in significantly increasedsecurity
 costs, damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased costs related to defending legalclaims.
Worldwide
 regulatory  authorities  are  considering  and  have  approved  various  legislative  proposals  concerning  data  protection,  which  continue  toevolve
 and apply to our business. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which requirescompanies
 to meet new requirements beginning in May 2018 regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the ability ofpersons whose data
 is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to4%
 of worldwide revenue. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe andelsewhere
 are often uncertain and fluid, and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, we maybe
 ordered to change our data practices and/or be fined. Complying with these changing laws has caused, and could continue to cause, us to incursubstanti
al costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, failure to comply with existing or new rulesmay result in significant penalties or orders to stop the allege
d noncompliant activity.We
 may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected taxrates.
As
 a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, networth,
 property  and  goods  and  services  taxes,  in  both  the  United  States  and  various  foreign  jurisdictions.  Our  domestic  and  international  taxliabilities
 are  subject  to  the  allocation  of  revenue  and  expenses  in  different  jurisdictions.  Significant  judgment  is  required  in  determining  ourworldwide provision for income taxes and other
 tax liabilities. Further, changes in United States federal, and state or international tax laws applicableto
 multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows, as we experienced in fiscalyear 2018 with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA.
Our
 future  effective  tax  rate  may  be  affected  by  such  factors  as  changes  in  tax  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or  statutory  rates,  changes  injurisdictions
 in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in available tax credits, the resolution of issues arising from taxaudits, changes in United States
 generally accepted accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases inexpenses not deductible for tax purposes, chang
es in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances,changing
 interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation and the recognition of excess taxbenefits
 and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period in which they occur, the impact of accounting for business combinations,shifts
 in the amount of earnings in the United States compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax, changes inour
 international organization, as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits. Any changes in our effective tax rate mayreduce our net income.
Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.
We have in the
 past and may, from time to time, face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and investigations involvingshareholder,
 consumer, competition and other issues relating to our business on a global basis. In the past, securities class action litigation hasoften been brought against a
 company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities and we have been in the past, and may be inthe
 future, the target of securities litigation. The laws and regulations our business is subject to are complex, and change frequently. We may berequired
 to incur significant expense to comply with, or remedy violations of, these regulations. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherentlyuncertain,
 and  adverse  rulings  could  occur,  including  monetary  damages,  or  an  injunction  stopping  us  from  manufacturing  or  selling  certainproducts, engaging in certain busin
ess practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing18
Table of Contentsof
 patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position,and overall trends. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigati
on can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations.Delaware
 law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft Corporation could delay orprevent a change in control.
Our
 status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or preventa
 change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after theperson becomes an interested shareh
older, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders. In addition, our certificate ofincorporation
 and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock.These provisions include
 the following:•
the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval;•
the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent;•
advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals;•
the ability of our Board of Directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval;•
a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;•
the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders; and•
the ability of our Board of Directors to make, amend or repeal our bylaws.On
 March  5,  2000,  we  entered  into  an  agreement  with  Microsoft  in  which  we  agreed  to  develop  and  sell  graphics  chips  and  to  license  certaintechnology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the agre
ement, if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase sharesequal
 to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase thestock.
 The Microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA. These provisions couldalso discourage proxy contests and make it
 more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporateactions they desire.

In
 November 2017, we increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.14 per share, or $0.56 on an annual basis, to $0.15 per share, or $0.60 on anannual basis. In fiscal years 
2018 and 2017 , we paid $341 million and $261 million , respectively, in cash dividends to our common sharehold ers.Our
 cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under the program are subject to continued capital availability and our Boardof
 Directors'  continuing  determination  that  the  dividend  program  and  the  declaration  of  dividends  thereunder  are  in  the  best  interests  of  ourshareholders
 and  are  in  compliance  with  all  laws  and  agreements  of  NVIDIA  applicable  to  the  declaration  and  payment  of  cash  dividends.  Incalendar
 year 2017 ,  based upon our earnings and profits, 100% of our dividend payments were considered to be ordinary dividends. It is possiblethat a portion of our dividend payments in future calendar years may be cons
idered a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes.Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Beginn
ing August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock. In November 2016, the Board authorized an additional  $2.00 billion 
 under our repurchase program and extended it through Dec ember 2020.Since
 the  inception  of  our  share  repurchase  program,  we  have  repurchased  an  aggregate  of   251  million  shares  under  our  share  repurchaseprogram for a total cost of  
$5.5 billion through January 28, 2018 . All shares delivered from these repurchases have been p laced into treasury stock.As
 of January  28, 2018 ,  we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to  $1.82 billion 
 through December  2020. For fiscal year 2019, we intend to return $1.25 billion to  our shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividendsand share repurchases.
The
 repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and can bemade
 in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to marketconditions,
 applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of commonstock
 and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion. As part of our share repurchase program, we may enter into structuredshare repurchase transactions with
 financial institutions. These agreements generally require that we make an up-front payment in exchange for theright
 to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement, and a potential incremental number of shares ofour common stock, within a pre-determined range, at the end of the term of the agreement.

Our Company and Our Businesses
Starting
 with  a  focus  on  PC  graphics,  NVIDIA  invented  the  GPU  to  solve  some  of  the  most  complex  problems  in  computer  science.  We  haveextended
 our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI. Fueled by the sustained demand for better 3D graphics and the scale of thegaming market, NVIDIA has evolved the GPU into a computer brain at the intersection of VR, HPC, an
d AI.Our two reportable segments
 - GPU and Tegra Processor - are based on a single underlying architecture. From our proprietary processors, we havecreated platforms that address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Gaming, Professional Visua
lization, Datacenter, and Automotive.While
 our GPU and CUDA architecture is unified, our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadrofor
 designers; Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brandintegrates
 an entire  computer  onto  a single chip,  and incorporates  GPUs and multi-core  CPUs to  drive supercomputing  for  autonomous  robots,drones, and cars, as well as for consoles and mobile gami
ng and entertainment devices.Headquartered in Santa Clara, Cal
ifornia, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges

GPU
 business revenue was $8.14 billion, up 40% from a year earlier, led by growth in gaming, datacenter, and professional visualization. Stronggrowth
 across our Pascal-based GeForce gaming GPUs was driven by growth associated with GPU refreshes/upgrades, new gamers, new games,eSports,
 and cryptocurrency mining. Revenue for datacenter, including Tesla, NVIDIA GRID and NVIDIA DGX, was $1.93 billion, up 133% year onyear,
 led by strong sales of our Volta architecture, including V100 GPU accelerators, which began shipping in the first half of fiscal year 2018 andare
 available through major computer makers and cloud providers, new DGX systems, and design wins in HPC. Professional visualization revenuegrew
 12% year over year to $934 million, led by ultra-high-end and high-end desktop workstations, as well as unique form factors and emergingopportunities, including AI, deep l
earning, VR and rendering.23
Table of ContentsTegra
 processor business revenue was $1.53 billion, up 86% from a year ago. Tegra processor business revenue includes SOC modules for theNintendo
 Switch gaming console and development services. Also included was automotive revenue of $558 million, which was up 15% from a yearearlier, incorporating infotainment modules, prod
uction DRIVE PX platforms, and development agreements for self-driving cars.Revenue from our patent license agreement with Intel concl
uded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 . Gross
 margin for fiscal year 2018 was  59.9%, compared with 58.8% a year earlier, reflecting a favorable shift in mix, the growth of our GeForcegaming
 GPUs,  and  the  growth  of  our  GPU  computing  platform  for  cloud,  deep  learning,  AI,  and  graphics  virtualization,  partially  offset  by  theconclusion of our patent license agreeme
nt with Intel.Operating expenses for
 fiscal year 2018 were  $2.61 billion, up from $2.13 billion in the previous year. This reflects growth in employees and relatedcosts, as well as investments in growth initiatives, includi
ng gaming, AI, and autonomous driving.We recorded a U.S. tax reform provisional net tax benefit of $133 million associate
d with the one-time transition tax on our historical foreign earningsand the adjustment of deferred tax balances to the lower corporate tax rate.
Net
 income and net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2018 were  $3.05 billion and $4.82, respectively, up 83% and 88%, respectively, from ayear earlier, fueled by strong revenue growth and improved gross a
nd operating margins.We
 returned  $1.25  billion  to  shareholders  in  fiscal  year 2018 through  a  combination  of  $909  million  in  share  repurchases  and  $341  million  inquarterly
 cash dividends. In November 2017, we declared an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.15 per share from $0.14 per share. Forfiscal year 2019, we intend to return $1.25 billio
n to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases.Cash,
 cash equivalents and marketable securities were $7.11 billion as of January  28, 2018 ,  compared with $6.80 billion as of January  29, 2017 . The increase was primarily related to the increase in op
erating income.GPU Business
During fiscal year 
2018 , we released many  new gaming GPU products based on our new NVIDIA Pascal architecture, including GeForce GTX 1070Ti,
 1080  Ti,  and  TITAN  Xp.  We  also  announced  gaming  laptops  using  the  Max-Q  design,  which  are  3x  faster  and  3x  thinner  than  previous-generation
 gaming  laptops,  and  enhanced  GeForce  Experience  with  new  tools,  including  NVIDIA  Freestyle  for  customizing  gameplay  and  anupdated
 interface  for  the  NVIDIA  Ansel™  photo  mode,  as  well  as  new  titles  including  PlayerUnknown's  Battleground  and  Fortnite  that  supportNVIDIA ShadowPlay™ High
lights for capturing gaming achievements.For our professional visualiz
ation platform, we opened early access to NVIDIA Holodeck, and launched the Quadro Virtual Data Center Workstation;introduced Project Holodeck, a photorea
listic, collaborative VR environment; launched external GPU support for creative professionals; and releasedthe NVIDIA Optix 5.0 and NVIDIA VRWorks 360 Video software devel
opment kits.For
 our datacenter platform, we announced that NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU accelerators are available through virtually every major computer makerand
 have  been  chosen  by  nearly  every  major  cloud  provider  to  deliver  AI  and  HPC.  We  added  34  GPU-accelerated  systems  to  the  Top  500supercomputer
 list,  bringing  the  total  number  of  systems  relying  on  NVIDIA  GPUs  to  87,  announced  partnerships  to  further  AI  in  key  verticalindustries,
 and launched the NVIDIA GPU Cloud container registry to support scientists using HPC applications and AI researchers using desktopGPUs.
Tegra Processor Business
During fiscal year 
2018 , for the automotive market, we announc ed the NVIDIA DRIVE AI self-driving platform, which enables automakers and Tier-1suppliers
 to accelerate production of automated and autonomous vehicles, the NVIDIA DRIVE Xavier autonomous machine processor to power theNVIDIA
 DRIVE  software  stack,  and  NVIDIA  DRIVE  PX  Pegasus,  an  auto-grade  AI  computer  designed  to  enable  driverless  robotaxis  withoutsteering wheels,
 pedals or mirrors. We also announced several new partnerships aimed at getting AI-powered cars, trucks and commercial vehicleson the road, including partnerships with A
urora, Autoliv, Baidu, Bosch, Continental, Mercedes-Benz, Uber, Volkswagen, Volvo, Toyota, and ZF.In
 addition, we introduced NVIDIA Jetson TX2, a high-performance, low-power computer platform for delivering AI at the edge, with deep learningand
 computer  vision  capabilities  for  robots,  drones  and  smart  cameras,  the  NVIDIA  Isaac  robot  simulator  for  training  intelligent  machines  insimulated
 real-world conditions before deployment, and the NVIDIA Metropolis platform, used by more than 50 partners to make cities safer andsmarter by applying deep learning to surveil
lance video streams.24
Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s
 discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, whichhave
 been prepared in accordance with accounting  principles generally accepted in the United States,  or U.S. GAAP.  The preparation  of thesefinancial
 statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue,expenses
 and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition,inventories,
 income  taxes,  goodwill,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities,  stock-based  compensation,  and  litigation,  investigation  andsettlement
 costs and other contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to bereasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgme
nts about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.We
 believe  the  following  critical  accounting  policies  affect  our  significant  judgments  and  estimates  used  in  the  preparation  of  our  consolidatedfinancial
 statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with theAudit
 Committee  of  our  Board  of  Directors.  The  Audit  Committee  has  reviewed  our  disclosures  relating  to  our  critical  accounting  policies  andestimates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Revenue Recognition
Product Revenue
We
 recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed ordeterminable and collection of the relate
d receivable is reasonably assured.Our
 customer  programs  primarily  involve rebates,  which are designed to serve as sales incentives  to resellers  of our products  in various  targetmarkets.
 We account for rebates as a reduction of revenue and accrue for 100% of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor, as wetypically
 find  that  over  95%  of  the  rebates  we  accrue  each  year  are  eventually  claimed,  which  is  substantially  close  to  100%,  and  that  thispercentage
 varies by program and by customer. We recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the relatedrevenue or the date at which we offer the rebate. Rebates typically expire six months from the date of the origin
al sale, unless we reasonably believethat
 the customer intends to claim the rebate. Unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue, the amount of which typically represents less than 0.5%of total revenue.
Our
 customer programs also include marketing development funds, or MDFs. MDFs represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked formarket
 segment development and expansion and are typically designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products.We account for
 MDFs as a reduction of revenue and apply a breakage factor to certain types of MDF program accruals for which we believe we canmake a reasonable and reliabl
e estimate of the amount that will ultimately be unclaimed. We
 also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized,based
 primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determinethat additional sales return allowa
nces are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.License and Development Revenue
For
 license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components, we generally recognize the related revenueover the
 period that services are performed. For most license and service arrangements, we determine progress to completion based on actual costincurred
 to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete the project. We periodically evaluate the actual status of eachproject
 to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate. Revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progresstoward
 completion  of  projects  in  progress.  Significant  management  judgment  and  discretion  are  used  to  estimate  total  cost.  Any  changes  in  ordeviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we reco
gnize in any period.For license arrangements that do
 not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of thelicense
 agreement, we record revenue over the life of the license term, with consideration received in advance of the performance period classifiedas deferred revenue.
Refer
 to  Note  1  of  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  Part  IV,  Item  15  of  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  additionalinformation.

Table of ContentsInventories
Inventory
 cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. We charge costof
 sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excessinventory.
 Most of our inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future productpurchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and m 
arket conditions. Situations
 that  may  result  in excess  or  obsolete  inventory  include changes in business  and economic  conditions,  changes  in market  conditions,sudden and significant decre
ases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements,failure
 to estimate customer demand properly, or unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition. In addition, cancellation or deferral ofcustomer purchase orders could result in our holding exc
ess inventory.The overall net
 effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was insignificant in fiscal years 2018 and 
2017 and  an unfavorable impact of 1.6% in fiscal year 2016 .  The charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions during these fiscalyears
 were primarily related to the write-off of excess quantities of products whose inventory levels were higher than our updated forecasts of futuredemand
 for those products. As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of futurecustomer
 demand.  In  doing  so,  we  must  account  for  our  third-party  manufacturers'  lead  times  and  constraints.  We  also  adjust  to  other  marketfactors,
 such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which mayimpact demand for our products.
Refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Disc
ussion and Analysis for further discussion.Income Taxes
We
 recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscalyear
 by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effectsattributable
 to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount ofany tax benefits that, based on available evi
dence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.Our
 calculation  of  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  is  based  on  certain  estimates  and  judgments  and  involves  dealing  with  uncertainties  in  theapplication
 of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to ananticipated
 outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes inother
 facts  or  circumstances.  In  addition,  we  recognize  liabilities  for  potential  United  States  and  foreign  income  tax  contingencies  based  on  ourestimate
 of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if therecorded
 tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expensein our financial statements accordingly.
As
 of January  28, 2018 ,  we had a valuation allowance of $469 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that managementdetermined
 are not likely to be realized due to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as aresult
 of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize suchdeferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period.
We
 recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on thetechnica
l merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income taxexpense.
The
 TCJA, which was enacted in December 2017, significantly changes U.S. tax law, including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income taxrate
 from  35%  to  21%,  a  requirement  for  companies  to  pay  a  one-time  transition  tax  on  the  earnings  of  certain  foreign  subsidiaries  that  werepreviously
 tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign-source earnings. As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of theTCJA
 began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions will impact us beginning in fiscal year 2019. Refer to Note13 of the Notes 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information specific toaccounting for income taxes and the impacts from the enactment of the TCJA.

Table of ContentsGoodwill
Goodwill
 is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier, if indicators of potential impairment exist,using
 either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which thegoodwi
ll resides to its carrying value. We have identified two reporting units, GPU and Tegra  Processor, for the purposes of completing our goodwillanalysis.
 Goodwill  assigned  to  the  GPU  and  Tegra  Processor  reporting  units  as  of January  28,  2018 was $210  million and $408  million , respectively.
 Determining  the  fair  value  of  a  reporting  unit  requires  us  to  make  judgments  and  involves  the  use  of  significant  estimates  andassumptions.
 We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units. We base our fair valueestimates on assumptions we believe to be reason
able but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain.We
 use the quantitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit. In applying the fair value based test of each reportingunit,
 the results from the income approach and the market approach were equally weighted. These valuation approaches consider a number offactors that
 include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, terminal or residual values, discount rates and comparablemultiples
 from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economicfactors and the future profitability of our business.
During
 the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 ,  we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill. The fair values of our GPU and TegraProcessor
 reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values. As such, even the application of a hypotheti cal  10% decrease tothe fair value of each reporting unit would not have resu
lted in the fair value of either reporting unit being less than its carrying value.Refe 
r  to  Note  4  of  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  Part  IV,  Item  15  of  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  additionalinformation.
Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
Cash
 equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at thetime
 of acquisition. Marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months when purchased.We
 measure  our  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities  at  fair  value.  The  fair  values  of  our  financial  assets  are  determined  using  quotedmarket
 prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets. All of our available-for-sale investments are subjectto a periodic impairment review. We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is signifi
cantly below cost basis and judged to be other-than-temporary, or have other indicators of impairments.
We
 performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of January  28, 2018 .  We concluded that our investments were appropriatelyvalued
 and that no other-than-temporary impairment charges were necessary on our portfolio of available-for-sale investments as of January  28,2018 
. Refe

Stock-based Compensation
Our
 stock-based compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units that are based on our corporatefinancial
 performance targets, or PSUs, performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs, and our employeestock
 purchase plan, or ESPP. The number of PSUs and market-based PSUs that will ultimately be awarded is contingent on the Company’s levelof
 achievement compared with the corporate financial performance target established by our Compensation Committee in the beginning of eachfiscal year.

Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs
From
 time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. We are aggressively defending our current litigationmatters.
 However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations, and we cannot be certain that these actions or otherthird-party
 claims  against  us  will  be  resolved  without  costly  litigation,  fines  and/or  substantial  settlement  payments.  If  that  occurs,  our  business,financial
 condition  and  results  of  operations  co uld  be  materially  and  adversely  affected.  If  information  becomes  available  that  causes  us  todetermine
 that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associatedwith such
27
Table of Contentsevents,
 we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materiallydifferent from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.

GPU business revenue increased by 40% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 led by growth in gaming, datacenter and
 professional  visualization.  Revenue  from  sales  of  GeForce  GPU  products  for  gaming  increased  over  20%,  reflecting  continued  strongdemand
 for our Pascal-based GPU products. Datacenter revenue, including Tesla, GRID and DGX, increased 133%, reflecting strong demandfrom
 hyperscale  and  cloud  customers  for  deep  learning  training  and  accelerated  GPU  computing  as  well  as  demand  for  HPC,  DGX  AIsupercomputing and GRID virtualization platforms.
 Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased by 12% due primarily tohigher
 sales  in  both  high  end  desktop  and  mobile  workstation  products.  Revenue  from  GeForce  GPU  products  for  mainstream  PC  OEMsincreased by over 90% due primarily to strong demand for GPU products targeted for cryptocurrency mining.
GPU
 business revenue increased by 39% in  fiscal year 2017  compared  to fiscal year 2016 .  This increase was primarily due to increasedrevenue
 from our GeForce GPU gaming and datacenter platforms. Sales of high-end GeForce GPU products for gaming increased over 40%,reflecting
 a  combination  of  continued  strength  in  PC  gaming  and  strong  demand  for  our  recent  Pascal-based  GPU  products.  Datacenterrevenue,
 including our Tesla, NVIDIA GRID, and DGX-1 brands, increased by 145%, reflecting strong demand for deep learning training for AI,cloud, accelerated, and virtualized

 and initial DGX-1 sales. Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased 11% due primarily to higher sales inhigh
 end  desktop  and  mobile  workstation  products.  Revenue  from  GeForce  GPU  products  for  mainstream  PC  OEMs  declined  compared  tofiscal year 2016.
Tegra Processor Business. 
  Tegra Processor business revenue increased by 86% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 . This was driven
 by an increase of over 300% in revenue from SOC modules for gaming platforms and development services, and an increase of 15% inautomotive revenue, primarily from infotainment modules, DRIVE PX platforms and dev
elopment agreements for self-driving cars.Tegra
 Processor business revenue increased by 47% in fiscal  year 2017 compared to fiscal  year 2016 .  This was driven by an increase of over50%
 in sales of Tegra products and services serving automotive systems and an increase of almost 50% in gaming development platforms andservices compared to fiscal year 2016.
All Other. 
Our  patent license agreement with Intel concluded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. For fiscal year 2018, we recognized relatedrevenue of 
$43 million , down from $264 million for fiscal years 2017 and 2016. Concentration of Revenue
Revenue
 from sales to customers outside of the United States and Other Americas accounted for  79% , 80% ,  and 79% of  total revenue for fiscalyears 
2018 ,  2017 ,  and  2016 ,  respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based o n  the location to which theproducts are initially billed eve
n if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location.No
 single customer represented more than 10% of total revenue for fiscal year 2018. In fiscal years 2017 and 2016, we had one customer thatrepresented 12% and 11% of our total revenue, respectively.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross
 profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductorspurchased
 from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs,including
 labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and componentcosts,
 and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stock-based compensationrelated to personnel associated with manufacturi
ng.Our
 overall  gross  margin  was 59.9% , 58.8% ,  and 56.1% for  fiscal years 2018 , 2017 ,  and 2016 ,  respectively.  These  increases  were  drivenprimarily
 by a favorable shift in mix, the growth of our GeForce gaming GPU revenue, and the growth of our datacenter revenue for cloud, deeplearning,
 AI, and graphics virtualization. The increase in fiscal year 2018 was partially offset by the conclusion of our patent license agreement withIntel in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.
Charges
 to  cost  of  sales  for  inventory  provisions  totaled  $48  million,  $62  million,  and  $112  million  for  fiscal  years 2018 , 2017 ,  and 2016 , respective
ly. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $35 million, $51 million, and $32 million for fiscal years 2018 , 2017 
,  and 2016, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously writtendown was insignificant for fiscal years 
2018 and 2017 , and an unfavorable impact of 1.6% for fiscal year 2016 . A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows:
GPU Business. 
The  gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal  year 2018 when  compared to fiscal  year 2017 ,  primarily due tostrong sales of our
 GeForce gaming GPU products and revenue growth in datacenter, including Tesla, GRID and DGX, for cloud, deep learning,AI,
 and graphics virtualization. The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal  year 2017 when  compared to fiscal  year 2016primarily due to
 product mix resulting from increased sales of our gaming, datacenter, and professional visualization GPU products, as well as acontinued decrease in sales vol
umes of lower margin PC OEM products.Tegra
 Processor Business.  The  gross margin of our Tegra Processor business increased during fiscal  year 2018 when  compared to fiscal year
 2017 ,  primarily  due  to  revenue  growth  in  gaming  development  platforms  and  automotive.  The  gross  margin  of  our  Tegra  Processorbusiness increased during 
fiscal year 2017 when compared to fiscal year 2016 ,  primarily due to fewer inventory provisions, and the absence ofthe warranty charge associated with the SHIELD tablet prod
uct recall during fiscal year 2016 . 29

Research
 and development expenses increased by 23% in  fiscal year 2018 compared  to fiscal year 2017 and  increased 10% in  fiscal year 2017 compared
 to fiscal year 2016 ,  driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, includingstock-based compensation expense.
Sales, General and Administrative
Sales, general
 and administrative expenses increased by 23% in  fiscal year 2018 compared to  fiscal year 2017 and  increased by 10% in fiscal year 2017 
compared  to  fiscal  year 2016 ,  driven  primarily  by  employee  additions  and  increases  in  employee  compensation  and  other  related  costs,including
 stock-based compensation expense. Offsetting these increases was a decrease in outside professional fees of $11 million in fiscal year2018 and $57 million in fisca
l year 2017 resulting from the resolution of our intellectual property disputes with Samsung and Qualcomm.Restructuring and Other Charges
In
 fiscal year 2016, we began to wind down our Icera modem operations. As a result, our operating expenses for fiscal year 2016 included $131million of restructuring and other charges.
Total Other Income (Expense)
Interest Income and Interest Expense
Interest
 income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $69 million , $54 million , and $39
 million in  fiscal years 2018 , 2017 ,  and 2016 ,  respectively.  The  increase  in  interest  income  was  primarily  due to  higher  average  investedbalances and higher yiel
ds on our investments from a rising interest rate environment.Interest
 expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% NotesDue
 2026 issued in September 2016, and the Convertible Notes issued in December 2013. Interest expense was $61 million , $58 million , and $47 million 
in fiscal years 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 . Other, Net
Other,
 net,  consists  primarily  of  realized  gains  and  losses  from  the  sale  of  marketable  securities,  sales  or  impairments  of  investments  in  non-affiliated
 companies, losses on early conversions of the Convertible Notes, and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Net other expensewas $22
 million and $25 million in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively, and was insignificant in fiscal year 2016. The net other expense in fiscalyears 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to loss
es on early conversions of the Convertible Notes.30
Table of ContentsIncome Taxes
The
 TCJA, which was enacted in December 2017, significantly changes U.S. tax law, including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income taxrate
 from  35%  to  21%,  a  requirement  for  companies  to  pay  a  one-time  transition  tax  on  the  earnings  of  certain  foreign  subsidiaries  that  werepreviously
 tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign-source earnings. As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of theTCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisi
ons will impact us beginning in fiscal year 2019.The
 corporate tax reduction is effective as of January 1, 2018. Since we operate on a fiscal year rather than a calendar year, we are subject totransitional
 tax rules. As a result, our fiscal year 2018 federal statutory rate is a blended rate of 33.9%. The change in the statutory tax rate from35% to 33.9% for fiscal year 2018 did not have a significant impact on the effective tax rate.
We
 recognized income tax expense of $149 million, $239 million and $129 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Our annualeffective
 tax rate was 4.7%, 12.5%, and 17.3% for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscalyear
 2018 as compared to fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to the provisional impact of the recent tax law changes and the recognitionof
 excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year2016
 was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits from our adoption of a new accounting standard in fiscal year 2017 related to thesimplification of certain aspects of stock-based compensation acc
ounting.Our
 effective  tax  rate  for  fiscal  year  2018  was  lower  than  the  blended  U.S.  federal  statutory  rate  of  33.9%  due  primarily  to  income  earned  injurisdictions,
 including British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federalstatutory
 tax rates, favorable recognition of the U.S. federal research tax credit, the provisional impact of the recent tax law changes in 2018, andexcess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.
Our
 effective  tax  rate  for  fiscal  years  2017  and  2016  was  lower  than  U.S.  federal  statutory  tax  rate  of  35%  due  primarily  to  income  earned  injurisdictions,
 including British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federalstatutory
 tax rates, favorable recognition in those fiscal years of the U.S. federal research tax credit, favorable discrete events primarily attributableto
 the tax benefit recognized upon the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations, and adoption of an accounting standard related to stock-based compensation in 
fiscal year 2017.For fiscal year
 2018, we recognized provisional amounts for the tax effects of the TCJA, which were included as components of income tax expenseand reflected
 in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018. We will continue to assess the impact of the recently enacted tax law on our business andour
 consolidated financial statements. The final impact of the TCJA recorded by us may vary materially from the provisional impact recorded due toa
 number  of  uncertainties  and  factors,  including  the  need  for  further  guidance  and  clarification  of  the  new  law  by  U.S.  federal  and  state  taxauthorities and the need for further guidance on the inc
ome tax accounting.In
 addition to the impact on fiscal year 2018, the TCJA also establishes new tax laws that will be effective for our fiscal year 2019. While each ofthese new tax laws is expected to have some impact on our tax expense for fiscal year 20
19 and future periods, we expect the provision designed totax the low-taxed income of foreign subsidiaries to have the most sign
ificant impact.Because
 of the complexity of the new tax laws on the low-taxed income of certain foreign subsidiaries, we are continuing to evaluate this provisionof
 the TCJA and the application of related accounting standards. Based on recent deliberations of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, orFASB,
 we expect  to  be allowed to  make an accounting  policy choice  of either  (1)  treating  taxes  due on future  taxable income in the U.S.  as acurrent-period
 expense when incurred or (2) factoring such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. Our selection of an accounting policywill depend, in part, on our analysis of releva
nt facts to determine what the expected impact would be under each method.Refer

January 28, 2018 , we had $7.11 billion in cash,  cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $310 million from  the end of fiscalyear 
2017 .  Our  portfolio  of  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities  is  managed  on  our  behalf  by  several  financial  institutions.  Our  portfoliomanagers
 are required to follow our investment policy, which requires the purchase of high grade investment securities, the diversification of assettypes, and certain limits on our portfolio duration.
Cash
 provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2018 compared  to fiscal year 2017 and  in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year2016, primarily due to higher net income and cha
nges in working capital.Cash
 provided  by  investing  activities  increased  in  fiscal  year 2018 compared  to  fiscal  year 2017 ,  primarily  due  to  a  reduction  in  purchases  ofmarketable
 securities, partially offset by the purchase of our previously-financed Santa Clara campus building. Cash used in investing activities forfiscal
 year 2017  increased  from fiscal year 2016 ,  primarily due to higher purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and lowerproceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities.
Cash
 used in financing activities increased in fiscal year 2018 compared  to fiscal year 2017 ,  primarily due to cash provided from the issuance of$2.00
 billion of Notes in fiscal year 2017 as well as higher repayments of Convertible Notes, tax payments related to employee stock plans, sharerepurchases
 and dividend payments in fiscal year 2018. Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year  2017 increased  from fiscal year 2016 , primarily
 due to the $2.00 billion of Notes issued in September 2016, partially offset by the repayments of Convertible Notes and $1.00 billion ofcapital return to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and divid
end payments.Liquidity
Our
 primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As ofJanuary 28, 2018 
and January 29, 2017 , we had $ 7.11 billion and $ 6.80 billion , respectively,  in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.Our marketable securities consist of
 debt securities issued by the United States government and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financialinstitutions,
 asset-backed  issuers,  mortgage-backed  securities  by  government-sponsored  enterprises,  and  foreign  government  entities.  Thesemarketable
 securities are denominated in United States dollars. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Part II, Item 7, Quantitativeand
 Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in Part II, Item 7A and Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV,Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
The
 recent TCJA that was signed into law in December 2017 subjects U.S. companies to a one-time transition tax on certain earnings of foreignsubsidiaries.
 Our reasonable estimate of the one-time transition tax that resulted from enactment of the TCJA is $401 million, which will be payablein
 eight annual installments. Accordingly, substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the United Statesas of
 January 28, 2018 will now be available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. Refer to Note 13 of the Notesto the Consolidated Financia

Table of ContentsCapital Return to Shareholders
During
 fiscal year 2018 ,  we repurchased a total of 6 million shares for $909 million and paid $341 million in  cash dividends to our shareholders. Asa result, we returned 
$1.25 billion to shareholders during fiscal year 2018 . For fiscal year 
2019 , we intend to  return $1.25 billion to shareholders through ongoing q uarterly cash dividends and share repurchases.Our
 cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board's continuing determination thatthe
 dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financi
al Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.Notes Due 2021 and Notes Due 2026
In
 fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2026. The net proceeds from the Notes were$1.98 billion, after deducting debt disc
ounts and issuance costs.Convertible Notes
As
 of January  28,  2018 ,  we  had $15  million of  Convertible  Notes  outstanding.  Refer  to  Note  11  of  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  FinancialStatements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.
Revolving Credit Facility
In
 fiscal year 2017, we entered into a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow, repay and re-borrow amounts from time to time, up to $575million.
 The commitments under the Credit Agreement are available for a 5-year period ending on October 7, 2021. The Credit Agreement alsopermits
 us to obtain additional revolving loan commitments and/or commitments to issue letters of credit of up to $425 million, subject to certainconditions.
 As  of January  28,  2018 ,  we  had  not  borrowed  any  amounts  and  were  in  compliance  with  all  related  covenants  under  the  CreditAgreement.
Commercial Paper
In
 December 2017, we established a commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. Under the program, we can issue up to$575 million in commercial paper. As of 
January 28, 2018 , there was no commercial paper outstanding. Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements
We
 believe  that  our  existing  cash  balances  and  anticipated  cash  flows  from  operations  will  be  sufficient  to  meet  our  operating  and  capitalexpenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In
 January 2018, we terminated the off-balance sheet, build-to-suit operating lease financing arrangement related to our new Santa Clara campusbuildi

 of January  28, 2018 ,  we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments. According to our analysis, parallelshifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5% would result in chan
ges in fair values for these investments of $14 million . In
 fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2026. In fiscal year 2014, we issued $1.50 billion 
of  Convertible Notes which had $15  million in  principal amount outstanding as of January  28, 2018 .  We carry the Notes at face value lessunamortized
 discount  on  our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  As  the  Notes  bear  interest  at  a  fixed  rate,  we  have  no  financial  statement  riskassociated
 with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of the Convertible Notes changes primarily when the market price of our stockfluctuates.

Foreign Exchange Rate Risk
We
 consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement areincluded
 in  other  income  or  expense  and  to  date  have  not  been  significant.  The  impact  of  foreign  currency  transaction  gain  or  loss  included  indetermining net income was not significant for fiscal years 201
8, 2017, and 2016.Sales
 and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject toexchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the Unite
d States’ dollar relative to other34
Table of Contentscurrencies
 would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value ofthe
 United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us.Additionally,
 we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses benefit from astronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dol
lar.We
 use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. Wedesignate
 these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses onthe
 contracts  are  recorded  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  or  loss,  and  then  reclassified  to  operating  expense  when  the  relatedoperating expenses are recognize
d in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.We
 also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that aredenominated
 in  currencies  other  than  U.S.  dollar.  These  forward  contracts  were  not  designated  for  hedge  accounting  treatment.  Therefore,  thechange
 in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currencydenominated monetary assets and liabi
lities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.Refer

Based
 on  their  evaluation  as  of January  28,  2018 ,  our  management,  including  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  hasconcluded
 that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, orthe Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable ass
urance.Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our
 management  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  adequate  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  as  such  term  is  defined  inExchange
 Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and ChiefFinancial
 Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January  28, 2018 based on the
 criteria  set  forth  in Internal

(2013)
issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  TreadwayCommission.
 Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal

,  our management concluded that ourinternal control over financial reporting was effective as of 
January 28, 2018 . The
 effectiveness  of our internal  control  over financial reporting  as of January  28, 2018 has  been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP, anindependent registered pub

There
 were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonablylikely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
35
Table of ContentsInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our
 management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures orour
 internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable,not
 absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there areresource
 constraints,  and  the  benefits  of  controls  must  be  considered  relative  to  their  costs.  Because  of  the  inherent  limitations  in  all  controlsystems,
 no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have beendetected.

 2017, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the threeyears
 in the period ended January 28, 2018, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item15(a)(2)
 (collectively  referred  to  as  the  “consolidated  financial  statements”).  We  also  have  audited  the  Company's  internal  control  over  financialreporting

Opinions
The
 Company's  management  is  responsible  for  these  consolidated  financial  statements,  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financialreporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, inc
luded in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control
 over  Financial  Reporting  appearing  under  Item  9A.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  opinions  on  the  Company’s  consolidated  financialstatements
 and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with thePublic
 Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  ("PCAOB")  and  are  required  to  be  independent  with  respect  to  the  Company  inaccordance
 with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and  regulations  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  and  thePCAOB.
We
 conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtainreasonable
 assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, andwhether effective internal control over financial reportin
g was maintained in all material respects.Our
 audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidatedfinancia
l statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, ona
 test  basis,  evidence  regarding  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Our  audits  also  included  evaluating  theaccounting
 principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  consolidatedfinancial
 statements.  Our  audit  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financialreporting,
 assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal controlbased
 on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  Webelieve that our audits provide a reasona
ble basis for our opinions.Definition
and
Limitations
of
Internal
Control

over
Financial
ReportingA
 company’s  internal  control  over  financial reporting  is a process  designed to  provide  reasonable assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financialreporting
 and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  Acompany’s
 internal  control  over  financial  reporting  includes  those  policies  and  procedures  that  (i)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  inreasonab
le detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance thattransactions
 are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,and
 that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors  of thecompany;
 and  (iii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of  thecompany’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Table of ContentsBecause
 of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  anyevaluation
 of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or thatthe degree of compliance with the polici
es or procedures may deteriorate./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

- Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesOur Company
Starting
 with  a  focus  on  PC  graphics,  NVIDIA  invented  the  GPU  to  solve  some  of  the  most  complex  problems  in  computer  science.  We  haveextended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of artificial inte
lligence.Headquartered in Santa Clara, Cal
ifornia, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.All
 references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries, except where it is made clear that theterm means only the parent company.
Fiscal Year
We
 operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2018 and 2017 are both 52-week years and fiscal year2016 was a 53-week year.
Reclassifications
Certain prior fiscal year balances have bee
n reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.Principles of Consolidation
Our
 consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balancesand transactions have been elimin
ated in consolidation.Use of Estimates
The
 preparation of financial statements  in conformity  with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions  that affect  thereported
 amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reportedamounts
 of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, weevaluate our estimates, including those
 related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories,income
 taxes,  goodwill,  stock-based  compensation,  litigation,  investigation  and  settlement  costs,  restructuring  and  other  charges,  and  othercontingencies. These estimates are based on h
istorical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.Revenue Recognition
Product Revenue
We
 recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed ordeterminable
 and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. For most sales, we use a binding purchase order and in certain caseswe
 use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement. We consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss havepassed
 to the customer. At the point of sale, we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection is reasonablyassured.
 If we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured, we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomesreasonably assured, which is genera
lly upon receipt of payment.Our
 customer  programs  primarily  involve rebates,  which are designed to serve as sales incentives  to resellers  of our products  in various  targetmarkets.
 We account for rebates as a reduction of revenue and accrue for 100% of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor, as wetypically
 find  that  over  95%  of  the  rebates  we  accrue  each  year  are  eventually  claimed,  which  is  substantially  close  to  100%,  and  that  thispercentage
 varies by program and by customer. We recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the relatedrevenue or the date at which we offer the rebate. Rebates typically expire six months from the date of the origin
al sale, unless we reasonably believethat
 the customer intends to claim the rebate. Unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue, the amount of which typically represents less than 0.5%of total revenue.
Our
 customer programs also include marketing development funds, or MDFs. MDFs represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked formarket segment development and expansion a
nd are typically designed to support our partners’47

(Continued)
activities
 while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for MDFs as a reduction of revenue and apply a breakage factor to certain types ofMDF program accruals for which we believe we can make a reason
able and reliable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be unclaimed.We
 also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized,based
 primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determinethat additional sales return allowa
nces are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.License and Development Revenue
For
 license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components, we generally recognize the related revenueover the
 period that services are performed. For most license and service arrangements, we determine progress to completion based on actual costincurred
 to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete the project. A provision for estimated losses on contracts is madein
 the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. Costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recordedas
 deferred costs on uncompleted contracts. If the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized, the excess amount is recorded asdeferred revenue.
For license arrangements that do
 not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of thelicense
 agreement, we record revenue over the life of the license term, with consideration received in advance of the performance period classifiedas deferred revenue.
Royalty
 revenue is recognized related to the distribution or sale of products that use our technologies under license agreements with third parties. We
 recognize royalty revenue upon receipt of a confirmation of earned royalties and when collectability is reasonably assured from the applicablelicensee.
Advertising Expenses
We
 expense advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred. Advertising expenses for fiscal years 2018 , 2017 ,  and 2016 were  $ 25 million 
, $17 million , and $30 million , respectively. Rent Expense
We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis ov
er the lease period and accrue for rent expense incurred, but not paid.Product Warranties
We
 generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for anymanufacturing
 defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at thepoint
 of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We alsoaccrue for known warranty and indemnification issu
es if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.Stock-based Compensation
We
 use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restrictedstock
 units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlosimulation
 on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs.The
 compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employeeservice
 period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of sharesto
 be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement  of an offering period inMarch
 and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally,we estimate
 forfeitures annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differfrom
 those estimates. If factors change, the compensation expense that we record under these accounting standards may differ significantly fromwhat we have recorded in the current period.

Restructuring and Other Charges
Our
 restructuring and other charges include employee severance and related costs, the write-down of assets, and other exit costs. The severanceand
 related costs include one-time termination benefits as well as certain statutory termination benefits or employee terminations under ongoingbenefit
 arrangements. One-time termination benefits are recognized as a liability at estimated fair value when the approved plan of termination hasbeen
 communicated to employees, unless employees must provide future service, in which case the benefits are recognized ratably over the futureservice
 period. Ongoing termination benefits arrangements are recognized as a liability at estimated fair value when the amount of such benefitsbecomes
 estimable and payment is probable. Any contract termination costs are recognized at estimated fair value when we terminate the contractin
 accordance with the contract terms. Other associated costs are recognized in the period the liability is incurred. Our operating expenses for fiscalyear 2016 included  
$131 million of restructuring and other charges related to  the wind-down of our Icera operations, which was comprised mainly ofemployee severance, facilities, and related costs. Restructuring ch
arges were not significant for fiscal years 2018 and 2017.Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs
From
 time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. We are aggressively defending our current litigationmatters.
 However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or otherthird-party
 claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. If that occurs, our business, financialcondition
 and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that aloss in
 any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events,we
 will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially differentfrom our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.
Foreign Currency Remeasurement
We
 use  the  United  States  dollar  as  our  functional  currency  for  all  of  our  subsidiaries.  Foreign  currency  monetary  assets  and  liabilities  areremeasured
 into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment, andequity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Reven
ue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period,except
 for those expenses related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains orlosses
 from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date havenot been significant.
Income Taxes
We
 recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscalyear
 by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effectsattributable
 to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount ofany tax benefits that, based on available evi
dence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.Our
 calculation  of  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  is  based  on  certain  estimates  and  judgments  and  involves  dealing  with  uncertainties  in  theapplication
 of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to ananticipated
 outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes inother
 facts  or  circumstances.  In  addition,  we  recognize  liabilities  for  potential  United  States  and  foreign  income  tax  contingencies  based  on  ourestimate
 of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if therecorded
 tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expensein our financial statements accordingly.
As
 of January  28, 2018 ,  we had a valuation allowance of $469  million related  to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that managementdetermined
 are not likely to be realized due to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as aresult
 of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize suchdeferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period.
49
Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
We
 recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on thetechnica
l merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income taxexpense.
In December 2017,
 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, was enacted into law. The TCJA significantly changes U.S. tax law including a reduction ofthe U.S. federal corporate income tax
 rate from 35% to 21%, a requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on the earnings of certainforeign
 subsidiaries  that  were  previously  tax  deferred  and  the  creation  of  new  taxes  on  certain  foreign-source  earnings.  As  a  fiscal  year-endtaxpayer,
 certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions will impact us beginningin fiscal year 2019. Refer to 
Note 13 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financi al Statements for additional information.Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive
 income consists of net income and other comprehensive income or loss. Other comprehensive income or loss components includeunrealized gains or losses on ava
ilable-for-sale securities and unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges.Net Income Per Share
Basic
 net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net incomeper
 share  is  computed  using  the  weighted  average  number  of  common  and  potentially  dilutive  shares  outstanding  during  the  period,  using  thetreasury
 stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the effect of stock options outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted netincome per share for periods when their effect is
 anti-dilutive. Additionally, we issued convertible notes with a net settlement feature that requires us,upon
 conversion,  to  settle  the  principal  amount  of  debt  for  cash  and  the  conversion  premium  for  cash  or  shares  of  our  common  stock.  Ourconvertible
 notes, note hedges, and related warrants contain various conversion features, which are further described in Note  11 of  these Notes tothe
 Consolidated Financial Statements. The potentially dilutive shares resulting from the convertible notes and warrants under the treasury stockmethod
 will be included in the calculation of diluted income per share when their inclusion is dilutive. However, unless actually exercised, the notehedges
 were not included in the calculation of diluted net income per share, as their pre-exercised effect would be anti-dilutive under the treasurystock method.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We
 consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time ofpurchase
 to be cash equivalents. As of January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017 ,  our cash and cash equivalents were $4.00 billion and $1.77 billion, respectively, including $ 
3.79 billion and $321 million , respectively, invested in money market funds. Marketable Securities
Marketable
 securities  consist  primarily  of  highly  liquid  investments  with  maturities  of  greater  than  three  months  when  purchased.  We  generallyclassify
 our  marketable  securities  at  the  date  of  acquisition  as  available-for-sale.  These  securities  are  reported  at  fair  value  with  the  relatedunrealized
 gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. The fairvalue
 of interest-bearing securities includes accrued interest. Any unrealized losses which are considered to be other-than-temporary impairmentsare
 recorded in the other income or expense, net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Realized gains and losses on the sale ofmarketable
 securities  are  determined  using  the  specific-identification  method  and  recorded  in  the  other  income  or  expense,  net,  section  of  ourConsolidated Statements of Income.
All
 of our available-for-sale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value issignificantly below cost basis and judged to be
 other-than-temporary, or have other indicators of impairments. If the fair value of an available-for-saledebt
 instrument is less than its amortized cost basis, an other-than-temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where (1) we intend to sellthe
 instrument, (2) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) a creditloss
 exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument. In these situations, we recognize an other-than-temporary
 impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments’ amortized cost basis and its fair value. For available-for-sale debt instruments that
 are considered other-than-temporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss, if we do not intend to sell and it isnot more likely than not that we will not be
 required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis (amortized cost basisless any current-period

(Continued)
credit
 loss), we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors. The credit losscomponent is recognized in earnin
gs while loss related to all other factors is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The
 carrying  value  of  cash  equivalents,  accounts  receivable,  accounts  payable  and  accrued  liabilities  approximate  their  fair  values  due  to  theirrelatively short maturities as of 
January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017 . Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported
 at fair  value with the related  unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated  other  comprehensive  income or loss,  a component  ofshareholders’
 equity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments arerecognized
 as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on theintended
 use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses arerecogniz
ed in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged.For
 derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as acomponent
 of  other  comprehensive  income  or  loss  and  is  subsequently  recognized  in  earnings  when  the  hedged  exposure  is  recognized  inearnings.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financi
al instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, accountsreceivab
le, note hedge and interest rate swap. Our investment policy requires the purchase of high grade investment securities, the diversification ofasset
 type  and  includes  certain  limits  on  our  portfolio  duration.  All  marketable  securities  are  held  in  our  name,  managed  by  several  investmentmanagers
 and  held  by  one  major  financial  institution  under  a  custodial  arrangement.  Accounts  receivable  from  significant  customers,  thoserepresenting 10% or more of total accounts receivable, aggregate
d approximately 28% of our accounts receivable balance from two customers as ofJanuary
 28, 2018 and 29% of  our account receivable balance from two customers as of January  29, 2017 .  We perform ongoing credit evaluationsof
 our  customers’  financial  condition  and  maintain  an  allowance  for  potential  credit  losses.  This  allowance  consists  of  an  amount  identified  forspecific
 customers  and  an  amount  based  on  overall  estimated  exposure.  Our  overall  estimated  exposure  excludes  amounts  covered  by  creditinsurance and letters of credit.
Accounts Receivable
We
 maintain  an  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts  receivable  for  estimated  losses  resulting  from  the  inability  of  our  customers  to  make  requiredpayments.
 We  determine  this  allowance  by  identifying  amounts  for  specific  customer  issues  as  well  as  amounts  based  on  overall  estimatedexposure.
 Factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables, the financial condition of our customers and the extent to whichbalances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit.
Inventories
Inventory
 cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costsconsist
 primarily  of  the  cost  of  semiconductors  purchased  from  subcontractors,  including  wafer  fabrication,  assembly,  testing  and  packaging,manufacturi
ng support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as thecost
 of purchased memory products and other component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to thelower
 of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to the write-off ofexcess
 quantities  of  products,  based  on  our  inventory  levels  and  future  product  purchase  commitments  compared  to  assumptions  about  futuredemand
 and  market  conditions.  Once  inventory  has  been  written-off  or  written-down,  it  creates  a  new  cost  basis  for  the  inventory  that  is  notsubsequently written-up.
Property and Equipment
Property
 and  equipment  are  stated  at  cost.  Depreciation  of  property  and  equipment  is  computed  using  the  straight-line  method  based  on  theestimated
 useful  lives  of  the  assets,  generally  three  to  five  years.  Once  an  asset  is  identified  for  retirement  or  disposition,  the  related  cost  andaccumulated
 depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirtyyears. Depreciation expense inclu
des the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded undercapital leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.

Goodwill
Goodwil
l is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist.  Forthe purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative a
nalysis on a reporting unit basis. For
 those reporting units where a significant change or event has occurred, where potential impairment indicators exist, or for which we have notperformed
 a  quantitative  assessment  recently,  we  perform  a  quantitative  assessment  to  testing  goodwill  for  impairment.  It  tests  for  possibleimpairment by applying a fair value-based test by wei
ghting the results from the income approach and the market approach. Refer to Note 4 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financi
al Statements for additional information. Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets
Intangible
 assets primarily represent rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, acquired intellectual property, trademarks and customerrelationships and are subject to an ann
ual impairment test. We currently amortize our intangible assets with definitive lives over periods ranging fromthree to ten years
 using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used upor, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortizatio
n method.Long-lived
 assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events orchanges
 in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be heldand
 used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected tobe
 generated by the asset, or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairmentcharge is recognized for
 the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or assetgroup.
 Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assetsand
 liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower ofthe carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no lon
ger be depreciated.Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In
 October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting standards update which requires the recognition ofincome
 tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. We elected to early adopt this newguidance
 in  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  year  2018,  which  required  us  to  reflect  any  adjustments  as  of  January  30,  2017.  Upon  adoption  of  thisguidance,
 we recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the first day of fiscal year 2018 to decrease retained earnings by  $28  million ,  with acorresponding decrease to prepaid taxes that ha
d not been previously recognized in income tax expense.In
 January  2017,  the  FASB  issued  an  accounting  standards  update  that  simplifies  the  test  for  goodwill  impairment.  The  update  eliminates  thesecond
 step in the goodwill impairment test that requires an entity to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. Instead, anentity
 should  recognize  an  impairment  loss  if  the  carrying  value  of  the  net  assets  assigned  to  the  reporting  unit  exceeds  the  fair  value  of  thereporting
 unit, with the impairment loss not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. We adopted this guidance in the fourthquarter
 of  fiscal  year  2018  and  applied  it  prospectively,  as  permitted  by  the  standard.  The  adoption  of  this  accounting  guidance  did  not  have  amaterial impact on our consolidated financi
al statements.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In
 January  2016,  the  FASB  issued  an  accounting  standards  update  to  amend  certain  aspects  of  recognition,  measurement,  presentation,  anddisclosure
 of  financial  instruments.  Most  prominent  among  the  amendments  is  the  requirement  for  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  our  equityinvestments
 to be recognized through net income rather than other comprehensive income. The update will be effective for us beginning in our firstquarter of
 fiscal year 2019. We anticipate the adoption of this accounting standard to increase the volatility of our other income or expense, net, dueto the remeasurement of certain of our equity securities, primarily our investments in non-affiliates, for fair value changes.

(Continued)
In
 February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update regarding the accounting for leases by which we will begin recognizing leaseassets
 and  liabilities  on  the  balance  sheet  for  leases  with  a  lease  term  of  more  than  12  months.  The  update  will  require  additional  disclosuresregarding
 key  information  about  leasing  arrangements.  Under  existing  guidance,  operating  leases  are  not  recorded  as  lease  assets  and  leaseliabil
ities on the balance sheet. The update will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted. Weare
 currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements. However, we expect theadoption
 of this accounting guidance to result in an increase in lease assets and a corresponding increase in lease liabilities on our ConsolidatedBalance Sheets.
The
 FASB issued an accounting  standards  update that  creates  a single source  of  revenue guidance under U.S.  GAAP for  all companies,  in allindustries.
 We expect to adopt this guidance beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. We havemade
 progress in, and continue to assess changes in policies, processes, systems and controls necessary to meet the additional requirements ofthe
 guidance. While we are still finalizing our analysis to quantify the adoption impact of the provisions of the new revenue standard, we do notexpect
 it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  However, we do expect to provide additional disclosure under thisguidance,
 including  more  information  regarding  estimates  and  judgments,  practical  expedients  used,  contract  balances  and  performanceobligations.

Beginning
 fiscal  year  2015,  we  shifted  away  from  granting  stock  options  and  toward  granting  RSUs,  PSUs  and  market-based  PSUs  to  reflectchanging
 market trends for equity incentives at our peer companies. As of January 28, 2018, there were 5 million stock  options outstanding and theamount
 of  unvested  stock  options  was  not  significant.  The  number  of  PSUs  that  will  ultimately  vest  is  contingent  on  the  Company’s  level  ofachievement versus the corporate financial performance target establ
ished by our Compensation Committee in the beginning of each fiscal year.Of
 the total fair value of equity awards, we estimated that the stock-based compensation expense related to the equity awards that are not expectedto vest for fiscal years 
2018 , 2017 , and 2016 was $156 million , $98 million , and $46 million , respectively.

0.3%-0.5%   0.7%-1.4%   1.5%-1.8% For ESPP shares, the expected term represents the average term from the first
 day of the offering period to the purchase date. The risk-free interestrate
 assumption  used  to  value  ESPP  shares  is  based  upon  observed  interest  rates  on  Treasury  bills  appropriate  for  the  expected  term.  Ourexpected
 stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grantdate.
 Our RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of RSUs, PSUs,and market-based PSUs are discounted for the divide
nd yield.Additionally,
 for employee stock option, RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures annually and revise the estimates offorfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical ex
perience.Equity Incentive Program
We grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights un
der the following equity incentive plans.Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan
In 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corp
oration 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as most recently amended and restated, the 2007 Plan.The
 2007  Plan  authorizes  the  issuance  of  incentive  stock  options,  non-statutory  stock  options,  restricted  stock,  restricted  stock  units,  stockappreciation
 rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to employees, directors and consultants.Only
 our employees may receive incentive stock options. Up to 207  million shares  of our common stock may be issued pursuant to stock awardsgranted under the 2007 Plan. Currently, we grant RSUs,

 hire date in the case of new hires or the anniversary of the date of grant in the case of grants to existing employeesand 
6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter. These stock options generally expire ten ye ars from the date of grant.Subject to certain exceptio

 thereafter,  and  (ii)  for  grants  made  on  or  after  May  18,  2016, 6.25% vesting  quarterly  thereafter.  Market-based  PSUs  vest 100% on approximately
 the three year anniversary of the date of grant. However, the number of shares subject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs thatare eligible to vest is generally determine
d by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of pre-determined criteria.Unless
 terminated sooner, the 2007 Plan is scheduled to terminate on March 21, 2022. Our Board may suspend or terminate the 2007 Plan at anytime.
 No awards may be granted under the 2007 Plan while the 2007 Plan is suspended or after it is terminated. The Board may also amend the2007
 Plan at any time. However, if legal, regulatory or listing requirements require shareholder approval, the amendment will not go into effect untilthe shareholders have approved the amen
dment.Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purcha

 2012,  our  shareholders  approved  the  2012  Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan,  as  most  recently  amended  and  restated,  the  2012  Plan,  as  thesuccessor to the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Pla
n.Up to 
75 million shares of  our common stock may be issued pursuant to purchases under the 2012 Plan. As of January 28, 2018, we had issued 28 million 
shares and reserved 47 million shares for future issuance under the 2012 Plan. The
 2012 Plan is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the currentofferings
 adopted pursuant to the 2012 Plan, each offering period is approximately 24 months, which is generally divided into four purchase periodsof six months.
Employees
 are eligible to participate if they are employed by us or an affiliate of us as designated by the Board. Employees who participate in anoffering
 may have up to 10% of  their  earnings withheld up to certain  limitations  and applied on specified  dates determined  by the Board to thepurchase
 of shares of common stock. The Board may increase this percentage at its discretion, up to 15% .  The price of common stock purchasedunder
 our 2012 Plan will be equal to 85% of  the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each offeringperiod
 and the fair market value on each purchase date within the offering. Employees may end their participation in the 2012 Plan at any timeduring the offering period, and participatio
n ends automatically on termination of employment with us. In each case, the employee’s contributions arerefunded.

fiscal year 2018 ,  our average stock price was $158.35 ,  which exceeded  both  the  adjusted  conversion  price  and the  adjusted  strike  price,causing the Convertible Notes and the Warrants to have a di

 entered  into  concurrently  with  the  issuance  of  the  Convertible  Notes,  as  its  effect  would  be  anti-dilutive.  In  the  event  of  conversion  of  theConvertible

We completed our annual impairment test
 during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 and concluded that there was no impairment, as the fair valueof
 our reporting units exceeded their carrying values. The fair value was determined by weighing the results from the income approach and themarket approach.
These
 income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information,growth
 rates,  residual  values,  discount  rates  and  comparable  multiples  from  publicly  traded  companies  in  our  industry  and  require  us  to  makecertain
 assumptions  and estimates  regarding  industry  economic  factors  and the future  profitability  of our  business.  When performing  an incomeapproach
 valuation, we incorporate the use of projected financial information and a discount rate that are developed using market participant basedassumptions
 to our discounted cash flow model. Our estimates of discounted cash flow were based upon, among other things, certain assumptionsabout
 our  expected  future  operating  performance,  such  as  revenue  growth  rates,  operating  margins,  risk-adjusted  discount  rates,  and  futureeconomic and
 market conditions. The market method of determining the fair value of our reporting units requires us to use judgment in the selectionof appropriate market comparables.

 and  2  for  fiscal  year  2018.  Level  3  assets  are  based  on  unobservable  inputs  to  the  valuation  methodology  and  include  our  own  data  aboutassumptions

In fiscal year 2016, we entered into an interest rate swap for a
 portion of the operating lease financing arrangement for our new Santa Clara campusbuilding.
 In January 2018, we terminated the operating lease financing arrangement and purchased the property. Concurrently, the related interestrate swap was terminated.
We
 enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses.We
 designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losseson the
 contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operatingexpenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.
 The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of  January 28, 2018  and January 29, 2017

We
 also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities thatare
 denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, thechange

- Guarantees U.S.
 GAAP requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes underthat
 guarantee. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued, including a tabular reconciliation of thechanges of the entity’s product warranty liabilities.

 on the Notes is payable on March 16 and September 16 of each year, beginning on March 16, 2017. Upon 30 days' notice to holders of theNotes, we
 may redeem the Notes for cash prior to maturity, at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and a make-wholepremium.
 However, no make-whole premium will be paid for redemptions of the Notes Due 2021 on or after August 16, 2021, or for redemptions ofthe

In fiscal year
 2014, we issued  $1.50 billion  of 1.00% Convertible Senior  Notes due 2018. Through January 28, 2018 ,  we had settled an aggregateof 
$1.48 billion  of  the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of the Company paying interest in cashsemi-annually
 at a rate of 1.00% per annum and will mature on December 1, 2018 unless previously repurchased or converted. Upon conversion,we pay
 cash up to the aggregate principal amount and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election, ofour conversion obligation in exc
ess of the aggregate principal amount being converted.Holders
 may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at any time prior to August 1, 2018 under certain circumstances. For example,during
 any fiscal quarter, if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days during a period of 30 consecutive tradingdays
 ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on eachapplicable
 trading day, the Convertible Notes become convertible at the holders' option. As  this condition has been met, all outstanding ConvertibleNotes are convertible at the holders’ option throug
h April 29, 2018.During
 fiscal year 2018 ,  we paid cash to settle $812  million  in  principal amount of the Convertible Notes and had $15  million in  principal amountoutstanding
 as of January  28, 2018 .  We also issued 33  million  shares  of our common stock for the excess conversion value and recognized aloss
 of  $19  million  on  early conversions of the Convertible Notes. Based on the closing price of our common stock of $243.33 on  the last tradingday
 of fiscal year 2018 ,  the if-converted value of the remaining outstanding Convertible Notes exceeded their principal amount by approximately $174
 million .  As of  January  28, 2018 ,  the conversion rate was  49.9127  shares  of common stock per $1,000 principal  amount of the ConvertibleNotes (equivalent to an adjusted conversi
on price of  $20.0350  per share of common stock). We
 separately accounted for the liability and equity components of the Convertible Notes as our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregateprincipal could be fully or partially settle

the
 fair  value  of  a  similar  debt  without  the  conversion  feature.  The  difference  between  the  net  cash  proceeds  and  the  liability  component  wasassigned
 as the equity component. The initial liability component of the Convertible Notes was valued at  $1.35 billion  and  the initial carrying valueof
 the equity component recorded in additional paid-in-capital was valued at  $126  million .  This equity component, together with the  $23  million purchaser's
 discount to the par value of the Convertible Notes, represented the initial aggregate unamortized debt discount of  $148  million . The debt discount is
 amortized as interest expense over the contractual term of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method and an interestrate of  
3.15% . As
 of January  28, 2018 ,  the carrying value of the Convertible Notes was classified as a current liability and the difference between the principalamount
 and the carrying value of the Convertible Notes was classified as convertible debt conversion obligation in the mezzanine equity section ofour Consolidated Balanc

 with  the  issuance  of  the  Convertible  Notes,  we  entered  into  a  convertible  note  hedge  transaction,  or  the  Note  Hedges.  The  NoteHedges have an adjusted strike
 price of $20.0350  per share  and allow us to receive shares of our common stock and/or cash related to the excessconversion

4.7% , 12.5% , and 17.3% for fiscal years 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively. In
 December 2017, the TCJA was enacted into law. The TCJA significantly changes U.S. tax law, including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporateincome tax rate from 
35% to 21% , a requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on 69

the
 earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign-source earnings. As afiscal
 year-end  taxpayer,  certain  provisions  of  the  TCJA  began  to  impact  us  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  year  2018,  while  other  provisions  willimpact us beginning in
 fiscal year 2019.The
 corporate tax reduction is effective as of January 1, 2018. Since we operate on a fiscal year rather than a calendar year, we are subject totransitional
 tax rules. As a result, our fiscal year 2018 federal statutory rate is a blended rate of 33.9% .  The change in the statutory tax rate from35% 
to 33.9% for fiscal year 2018 did not have a significant impact on the effective tax rate. U.S.
 GAAP requires companies to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment. However, the SEC also issued guidance thatallows
 companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to exceed one year. Accordingly, as of January 28, 2018, werecognized a provisional
 tax benefit of $133 million as a component of income tax expense, which is our reasona ble estimate of the effects of the taxlaw changes on existing deferred tax bal
ances and the calculation of the one-time transition tax.The
 one-time transition tax is based on the post-1986 earnings and profits, or E&P, of our foreign subsidiaries. We had previously accrued deferredtaxes
 on a portion of these same earnings. We recorded a provisional one-time transition tax liability of $971  million and  released the previouslyaccrued deferred tax liabilities of 
$1.15 billion , resulting in a net decrease to income tax expense of $176 million . We
 have reasonably estimated, but not yet completed, the calculation of the total post-1986 E&P for our foreign subsidiaries. Our calculation of thetransition
 tax may change with further analysis, additional guidance from the U.S. federal and state tax authorities and additional guidance for theassociated income tax accounting.
As
 a result of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21%, companies were required to remeasure their deferred tax assets and liabilitiesas of
 the date of enactment. As a result, we recorded a provisional income tax expense of $43 million on the write-down of our deferred tax balance. The
 decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to the provisional impact ofthe
 tax law changes and the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscalyear
 2017  as  compared  to  fiscal  year  2016  was  primarily  due  to  the  recognition  of  excess  tax  benefits  from  our  adoption  of  a  new  accountingstandard in fiscal year 2017 related to the simplificatio
n of certain aspects of stock-based compensation accounting.Our
 effective  tax  rate  for  fiscal  year  2018  was  lower  than  the  blended  U.S.  federal  statutory  rate  of  33.9%  due  primarily  to  income  earned  injurisdictions,
 including British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federalstatutory
 tax rates, favorable recognition of the U.S. federal research tax credit, the provisional impact of the recent tax law changes in 2018, andexcess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.
Our
 effective  tax  rate  for  fiscal  years  2017  and  2016  was  lower  than  U.S.  federal  statutory  tax  rate  of  35%  due  primarily  to  income  earned  injurisdictions,
 including British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federalstatutory
 tax rates, favorable recognition in those fiscal years of the U.S. federal research tax credit, favorable discrete events primarily attributableto
 the tax benefit recognized upon the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations, and adoption of an accounting standard related to stock-based compensation in 
fiscal year 2017.As
 of January  28, 2018 and January 29, 2017 ,  we had a valuation allowance of $469  million and $353 million ,  respectively, related to state andcertain
 foreign deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to projections of future taxable income. To theextent
 realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefitduring the period.
As
 of January  28,  2018 ,  we  had  federal,  state  and  foreign  net  operating  loss  carryforwards  of $74  million , $226  million and $281  million , respectively.
 The federal and state carryforwards will expire beginning in fiscal year 2023 and 2019, respectively. The foreign net operating losscarryforwards of 
$281 million may  be carried forward indefinitely. As of January  28, 2018 ,  we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $361 million 
that  will  begin  to  expire  in  fiscal  year  2032.  We  have  state  research  tax  credit  carryforwards  of $575  million ,  of  which $554  million is attributable
 to  the  State  of  California  and  may  be  carried  over  indefinitely,  and $21  million is  attributable  to  various  other  states  and  will  expirebeginning
 in fiscal year 2019. Our tax attributes, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, remain subject to audit and may be adjusted forchanges or modification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretati
ons thereof, or other facts and circumstances.70

Utilization
 of  federal,  state,  and  foreign  net  operating  losses  and  tax  credit  carryforwards  may  also  be  subject  to  limitations  due  to  ownershipchanges
 and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state and foreign tax provisions. If any such limitations apply, thefederal, states, or foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, as applicable, may expire or be d
enied before utilization.As
 of January  28,  2018 ,  we  had $447  million of  gross  unrecognized  tax  benefits,  of  which $413  million would  affect  our  effective  tax  rate  ifrecognized.
 However,  approximately $58  million of  the  unrecognized  tax  benefits  were  related  to  state  income  tax  positions  taken,  that,  ifrecognized,
 would  be  in  the  form  of  a  carryforward  deferred  tax  asset  that  would  likely  attract  a  full  valuation  allowance.  The $413  million of unrecognized tax benefits as of 
January 28, 2018 consisted of $175 million recorded in non-current income taxes payable and $238 million reflected as a reduction to the related deferred tax assets.
A reconciliation of gross unrecognize
d tax benefits is as follows:

$ 447  $224  $230 The increase in
 the unrecognized tax benefit in fiscal year 2018 is primarily due to the one-time transition tax imposed on foreign earnings under theTCJA.
 We classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount refundable, to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt ofcash
 for income taxes within one year. The amount is classified as a long-term liability, or reduction of long-term deferred tax assets or amountrefundable if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes durin
g a period beyond a year.Our
 policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of January 28, 2018 , January
 29, 2017 , and January  31, 2016 ,  we had accrued $15 million , $13 million , and $11 million ,  respectively, for the payment of interest andpenalties
 related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not included as a component of our unrecognized tax benefits. As of January  28, 2018 , unrecognized tax benefits of 
$175 million and the related interest and penalties of $15 million are included in non-current income taxes paya ble.While
 we  believe  that  we  have  adequately  provided  for  all  tax  positions,  amounts  asserted  by  tax  authorities  could  be  greater  or  less  than  ouraccrued
 position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revisedestimates
 are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. As of January  28, 2018 ,  we do not believe that our estimates, asotherwise provided for, on such tax positions will si
gnificantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.We
 are  subject  to  taxation  by  a  number  of  taxing  authorities  both  in  the  United  States  and  throughout  the  world.  As  of January  28, 2018 ,  thesignificant
 tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include the United States, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, United Kingdom, Germany,and
 India for fiscal years 2003 through 2017. As of January  28, 2018 ,  the significant tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under examinationinclude India, Taiwan, UK, and Germany for fiscal years 2003 throu

- Shareholders’ Equity Capital Return Program
Beginning August 200
4, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.During fiscal year

Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
Through 
January 28, 2018 ,  we have repurchased an aggregate of  251 million  shares under  our share repurchase program for a total cost of  $5.5 billion 
.  All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. As of January  28, 2018 ,  we were authorized, subject tocertain specifications, to repurchase addition
al shares of our common stock up to  $1.82 billion  through December 2020. Preferred Stock
As of 
January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017 , there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding. Common Stock
We are authorized to issue up to 
2.00 billion shares of our common stock at $0.001 per share par value. Note 15 - Employee Retirement Plans
We have a 401(k) retirement plan covering substantially al
l of our United States employees. Under the plan, participating employees may defer up to80% 
of  their  pre-tax  earnings,  subject  to  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  annual  contribution  limits  and  we  match  a  portion  of  the  employeecontributions.
 Our contribution expense for fiscal years 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 was $23 million , $12 million , and $8 million ,  respectively. We alsohave
 defined contribution retirement plans outside of the United States to which we contributed $25  million , $23 million ,  and $21  million for fiscal years 
2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively. Note 16 
- Segment Information  Our
 Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on anoperating
 segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. Our operating segments are equivalentto our reportable segments.
We
 report our business in two primary reportable segments - the GPU business and the Tegra Processor business - based on a single underlyinggraphics architecture.
While
 our GPU and CUDA architecture is unified, our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadrofor
 designers; Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brandintegrates
 an entire  computer  onto  a single chip,  and incorporates  GPUs and multi-core  CPUs to  drive supercomputing  for  autonomous  robots,drones, and cars, as well as for consoles and mobile gami
ng and entertainment devices.Under
 the single unifying graphics architecture for our GPU and Tegra Processors, we leverage our visual computing expertise by charging theoperating
 expenses of certain core engineering functions to the GPU business, while charging the Tegra Processor business for the incrementalcost
 of  the  teams  working  directly  for  that  business.  In  instances  where  the  operating  expenses  of  certain  functions  benefit  both  reportablesegments, our CODM assigns 100% of those expenses to the reportable segment that ben
efits the most.The
 “All Other” category presented below represents the revenue and expenses that our CODM does not assign to either the GPU business or theTegra
 Processor business for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The revenue includes primarily patentlicensing
 revenue  and  the  expenses  include  stock-based  compensation  expense,  corporate  infrastructure  and  support  costs,  acquisition-relatedcosts,
 legal settlement costs, contributions, restructuring and other charges, product warranty charge, and other non-recurring charges and benefitsthat our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.
Our
 CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Reportable segments do not record intersegmentrevenue,
 and, accordingly, there is none to be reported. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for NVIDIA as a whole. Thetable below presents details of our reportable se
gments and the “All Other” category.72

1.
GENERAL; PURPOSE.(a) 
The  Plan is intended as the successor to and continuation of the NVIDIA Corporation 1998 Employee StockPurchase Plan (the “ 
1998
Plan
 ”). From and after  12:01 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on the Effective Date, no additional rights topurchase
 shares of Common Stock will be granted under the 1998 Plan. All rights to purchase shares granted on or after 12:01a.m.
 Pacific Standard Time on the Effective Date will be granted under this Plan. Any rights to purchase shares of CommonStock
 granted  under  the  1998  Plan  will  remain  subject  to  the  terms  of  the  1998  Plan  and  any  offering  document  or  otheragreements or governing documents describing the terms and conditions of offerings made pursuant to the 1998 Plan.
(i) 
Any  shares of Common Stock that would otherwise remain available for future offerings under the 1998Plan
 as of 12:01 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on the Effective Date (the “ 1998 
Plan’s
Available
Reserve
”)  will cease to beavailable under
 the 1998 Plan at such time. Instead, that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the 1998 Plan’s AvailableReserve
 will be added to the Share Reserve (as further described in Section 3(a) below) and be then immediately available forgrants hereunder, up to the maximum number set forth in Section 3(a) below.
(ii) 
In  addition, from and after 12:01 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on the Effective Date, with respect to theaggregate number
 of shares subject, at such time, to outstanding grants under the 1998 Plan that would, but for the operation ofthis
 sentence, subsequently return to the share reserve of the 1998 Plan (such shares, the “ Returning 
Shares
”),  such sharesof
 Common Stock will not return to the share reserve of the 1998 Plan, and instead that number of shares of Common Stockequal
 to the Returning Shares will immediately be added to the Share Reserve as and when such a share becomes a ReturningShare, up to a maximum number set forth in Section 3(a) below.
(b) 
The  Plan provides a means by which Eligible Employees of the Company and certain Designated Companiesmay
 be  given  an  opportunity  to  purchase  shares  of  Common  Stock.  The  Plan  permits  the  Company  to  grant  a  series  ofPurchase Rights to Eligible Employees.
(c) 
The  Company, by means of the Plan, seeks to retain the services of such Employees, to secure and retain theservices of new Employees and
 to provide incentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts for the success of the Companyand its Related Corporations.
(d) 
This  Plan includes two components: a 423 Component and a Non-423 Component. It is the intention of theCompany
 to have the 423 Component qualify as an Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The provisions of the 423 Component,accordingly,
 will be construed in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of Section 423 of the Code. In addition, thisPlan
 authorizes  the  grant  of  Purchase  Rights  under  the  Non-423  Component  that  does  not  meet  the  requirements  of  anEmployee
 Stock Purchase Plan because of deviations necessary or advisable to permit or facilitate participation in the Plan byEmployees who are foreign nationals
or employed or located outside of the United States while complying with applicable foreign laws; such Purchase Rights will begranted
 pursuant  to  rules,  procedures  or  subplans  adopted  by  the  Board  designed  to  achieve  these  objectives  for  EligibleEmployees
 and the Company and its Related Corporations. Except as otherwise provided herein or determined by the Board,the
 Non-423 Component will operate and be administered in the same manner as the 423 Component. In addition, under the423
 Component of the Plan, the Company may make separate Offerings which vary in terms (although not inconsistent with theprovisions
 in the Plan and not inconsistent with the requirements of an Employee Stock Purchase Plan) and the Company willdesignate which Designated Company is participating in each separate Offering.
(e) 
If a  Participant transfers employment from the Company or any Designated 423 Corporation participating in the423
 Component  to  a  Designated  Non-423  Corporation  participating  in  the  Non-423  Component,  he  or  she  will  immediatelycease
 to participate in the 423 Component; however, any Contributions made for the Purchase Period in which such transferoccurs
 will be transferred to the Non-423 Component, and such Participant will immediately join the then current Offering underthe
 Non-423 Component upon the same terms and conditions in effect for his or her participation in the Plan, except for suchmodifications
 as  may  be  required  by  applicable  law.  A  Participant  who  transfers  employment  from  a  Designated  Non-423Corporation participating
 in the Non-423 Component to the Company or any Designated 423 Corporation participating in the 423Component
 will remain a Participant in the Non-423 Component until the earlier of (i) the end of the current Offering Periodunder
 the  Non-423  Component,  or  (ii)  the  Offering  Date  of  the  first  Offering  in  which  he  or  she  participates  following  suchtransfer.
2. 
ADMINISTRATION. (a) 
The  Board  will  administer  the  Plan  unless  and  until  the  Board  delegates  administration  of  the  Plan  to  aCommittee or Committees, as provided in Section 2(c).
(b) 
The Board will have the power, subject to, and within the limitations of, the express provisions of the Plan: (i) 
To  determine how and when Purchase Rights will be granted and the provisions of each Offering (whichneed
 not be identical), including which Designated 423 Corporations and Designated Non-423 Corporations will participate inthe 423 Component or the Non-423 Component.
(ii) 
To designate from time  to time which Related Corporations of the Company will be eligible to participatein
 the  Plan  as  Designated  423  Corporations  and  Designated  Non-423  Corporations  and  which  Affiliates  will  be  eligible  toparticipate
 in the Plan as Designated Non-423 Corporations and also to designate which Designated Companies will participatein each separate Offering (to the extent the Company makes separate Offerings).
(iii) 
To construe  and interpret the Plan and Purchase Rights, and to establish, amend and revoke rules andregulations
 for its administration. The Board, in the exercise of this power, may correct any defect, omission or inconsistency inthe Plan, in a manner and to the extent it deems necessary or expedient to make the Plan fully effective.
(iv) 
To settle all controversies regarding the Plan and Purchase Rights granted under the Plan. (v) 
To suspend or terminate the Plan at any time as provided in Section 12. (vi) 
To amend the Plan at any time as provided in Section 12. (vii) Generally,  to exercise such powers and to perform such acts as it deems necessary or expedient topromote
 the best interests of the Company and its Related Corporations and to carry out the intent that the 423 Component betreated as an Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
(viii) 
To  adopt  such  procedures  and  sub-plans  as  are  necessary  or  appropriate  to  permit  or  facilitateparticipation
 in  the  Plan  by  Employees  who  are  foreign  nationals  or  employed  or  located  outside  the  United  States.  Withoutlimiting
 the generality of, but consistent with, the foregoing, the Board specifically is authorized to adopt rules, procedures andsubplans,
 which, for purposes of the Non-423 Component, may be outside the scope of Section 423 of the Code, regarding,without
 limitation,  eligibility  to  participate  in  the  Plan,  handling  and  making  of  Contributions,  establishment  of  bank  or  trustaccounts
 to hold Contributions, payment of interest, conversion of local currency, obligations to pay payroll tax, determination ofbeneficiary
 designation requirements, withholding procedures and handling of share issuances, which may vary according tolocal requirements.
(c) 
The  Board  may  delegate  some  or  all  of  the  administration  of  the  Plan  to  a  Committee  or  Committees.  Ifadministration
 is  delegated  to  a  Committee,  the  Committee  will  have,  in  connection  with  the  administration  of  the  Plan,  thepowers
 theretofore possessed by the Board that have been delegated to the Committee, including the power to delegate to asubcommittee any of the administrative powers the Committee is authorized to exercise (and references in this Plan to the Board
will
 thereafter be to the Committee or subcommittee), subject, however, to such resolutions, not inconsistent with the provisionsof the Plan, as may be adopted from time to time by the Board. The Board may retain the authority to concurrently administer the
Plan
 with the Committee and may, at any time, revest in the Board some or all of the powers previously delegated. Whether ornot
 the Board has delegated administration of the Plan to a Committee, the Board will have the final power to determine allquestions of policy and expediency that may arise in the administration of the Plan.
(d) 
All  determinations,  interpretations  and  constructions  made  by  the  Board  in  good  faith  will  not  be  subject  toreview by any person and will be final, binding and conclusive on all persons.
3. 
SHARES OF COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN. (a) 
Subject  to  the  provisions  of  Section  11(a)  relating  to  Capitalization  Adjustments,  the  maximum  aggregatenumber
 of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the Plan will not exceed 77,932,333 shares of Common Stock(the
 “ Share
Reserve
”),  which number is the sum of (i) 10,000,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2016 AnnualMeeting of
 Stockholders, (ii) 12,500,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, (iii)32,000,000
 shares  that  were  approved  at  the  Company’s  2012  Annual  Meeting  of  Stockholders,  (iv)  the  number  of  sharessubject
 to the 1998 Plan’s Available Reserve, in an amount not to exceed 8,432,333 shares, and (v) the number of shares thatare Returning Shares, as such shares become available from time to time, in an amount not to exceed 15,000,000 shares.
(b) 
If  any Purchase Right granted under the Plan terminates without having been exercised in full, the shares ofCommon Stock not purchased under such Purchase Right will again become available for issuance under the Plan.
(c) 
The  stock purchasable under the Plan will be shares of authorized but unissued or reacquired Common Stock,including shares repurchased by the Company on the open market.
4. 
GRANT OF PURCHASE RIGHTS; OFFERING. (a) 
The Board  may from time to time grant or provide for the grant of Purchase Rights to Eligible Employees underan
 Offering  on  Offering  Dates  selected  by  the  Board.  Each  Offering  will  be  in  such  form  and  will  contain  such  terms  andconditions
 as  the  Board  will  deem  appropriate,  and  with  respect  to  the  423  Component  will  comply  with  the  requirement  ofSection
 423(b)(5)  of  the  Code  that  all  Employees  granted  Purchase  Rights  will  have  the  same  rights  and  privileges.  Theprovisions of separate Offerings need not be identical, but each
Offering will include (through incorporation of the provisions of this Plan by reference in the document comprising the Offering orotherwise)
 the  period  during  which  the  Offering  will  be  effective,  which  period  will  not  exceed  27  months  beginning  with  theOffering Date, and the substance of the provisions contained in Sections 5 through 8, inclusive.
(b) 
If  a Participant has more than one Purchase Right outstanding under the Plan, unless he or she otherwiseindicates in forms delivered to the
 Company: (i) each form will apply to all of his or her Purchase Rights under the Plan; and (ii) aPurchase
 Right with a lower exercise price (or an earlier-granted Purchase Right, if different Purchase Rights have identicalexercise
 prices) will be exercised to the fullest possible extent before a Purchase Right with a higher exercise price (or a later-granted Purchase Right if different Purchase Rights have identical exercise prices) will be exercised.
(c) 
The  Board  will  have  the  discretion  to  structure  an  Offering  so  that  if  the  Fair  Market  Value  of  a  share  ofCommon
 Stock on the first Trading Day of a new Purchase Period within that Offering is less than or equal to a Participant’sOffering Date Price, then with respect to such Participant, that Offering will terminate immediately as of that first Trading Day and
such Participant will be automatically enrolled in a new Offering beginning on that first Trading Day.
5. 
ELIGIBILITY. (a) 
Purchase  Rights  may  be  granted  only  to  Employees  of  the  Company  or,  as  the  Board  may  designate  inaccordance
 with Section 2(b), to Employees of a Related Corporation or an Affiliate. Except as provided in Section 5(b), anEmployee
 will not be eligible to be granted Purchase Rights unless, on the Offering Date, the Employee has been in the employof
 the Company, a Related Corporation or an Affiliate, as the case may be, for such continuous period preceding such OfferingDate
 as the Board may require, but in no event will the required period of continuous employment be equal to or greater thantwo years. In addition, the Board may (unless prohibited by law) provide that no Employee will be eligible to be granted Purchase
Rights
 under the Plan unless, on the Offering Date, such Employee’s customary employment with the Company, the RelatedCorporation or the Affiliate is
 more than 20 hours per week and more than five months per calendar year or such other criteria asthe Board may determine consistent with Section 423 of the Code.
(b) 
The  Board may provide that each person who, during the course of an Offering (or any specified period withinan
 Offering), first becomes an Eligible Employee will, on or after the day on which such person becomes an Eligible Employee,be
 granted a Purchase Right under that Offering, which Purchase Right will thereafter be deemed to be a part of that Offering.Such
 Purchase  Right  will  have  the  same  characteristics  as  any  Purchase  Rights  originally  granted  under  that  Offering,  asdescribed herein, except that:
(i) 
the  date on which such Purchase Right is granted will be the “Offering Date” of such Purchase Right forall purposes;
(ii) 
the  period of the Offering with respect to such Purchase Right will begin on its Offering Date and endcoincident with the end of the original Offering; and
(iii) 
the  Board may provide that if such person first becomes an Eligible Employee within a specified periodof time before the end of the Offering, he or she will not be granted any Purchase Right under that Offering.
(c) 
No  Employee  will  be  eligible  for  the  grant  of  any  Purchase  Rights  if,  immediately  after  any  such  PurchaseRights
 are granted, such Employee owns stock possessing five percent or more of the total combined voting power or value ofall
 classes  of  stock  of  the  Company  or  of  any  Related  Corporation  (unless  otherwise  required  by  law).  For  purposes  of  thisSection
 5(c), the rules of Section 424(d) of the Code will apply in determining the stock ownership of any Employee, and stockwhich
 such Employee may purchase under all outstanding Purchase Rights and options will be treated as stock owned by suchEmployee.
(d) As  specified by Section 423(b)(8) of the Code, an Eligible Employee may be granted Purchase Rights only ifsuch
 Purchase Rights, together with any other rights granted under all Employee Stock Purchase Plans of the Company andany
 Related  Corporations,  do  not  permit  such  Eligible  Employee’s  rights  to  purchase  stock  of  the  Company  or  any  RelatedCorporation
 to accrue at a rate which exceeds $25,000 of Fair Market Value of such stock (determined at the time such rightsare
 granted, and which, with respect to the Plan, will be determined as of their respective Offering Dates) for each calendar yearin which such rights are outstanding at any time.
(e) 
Officers  of  the  Company  and  any  Designated  Company,  if  they  are  otherwise  Eligible  Employees,  will  beeligible
 to  participate  in  Offerings  under  the  Plan.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  Board  may  (unless  prohibited  by  law)provide in an Offering that Employees who are highly compensated Employees within the meaning of Section 423(b)(4)(D) of the
Code will not be eligible to participate.
6. 
PURCHASE RIGHTS; PURCHASE PRICE. (a) 
On  each Offering Date, each Eligible Employee will be granted a Purchase Right under the applicable Offeringto
 purchase  up  to  that  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  purchasable  either  with  a  percentage  or  with  a  maximum  dollaramount,
 as designated by the Board but in either case not exceeding 15% of such Employee’s eligible earnings (as defined bythe
 Board in each Offering) during the period that begins on the Offering Date (or such other date as the Board determines for aparticular Offering) and ends on the date stated in the Offering, which date will be no later than the end of the Offering.
(b) 
The Board  will establish one or more Purchase Dates during an Offering on which Purchase Rights granted forthat Offering will be exercised and shares of Common Stock will be purchased in accordance with such Offering.
(c) 
In connection  with each Offering made under the Plan, the Board may specify (i) a maximum number of sharesof
 Common  Stock  that  may  be  purchased  by  any  Participant  on  any  Purchase  Date  during  such  Offering,  (ii)  a  maximumaggregate number of
 shares of Common Stock that may be purchased by all Participants pursuant to such Offering, and/or (iii) amaximum
 aggregate  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  that  may  be  purchased  by  all  Participants  on  any  Purchase  Dateunder
 the Offering. If the aggregate purchase of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Purchase Rights grantedunder
 the Offering would exceed any such maximum aggregate number, then, in the absence of any Board action otherwise, apro
 rata (based on each Participant’s accumulated Contributions) allocation of the shares of Common Stock available will bemade in as nearly a uniform manner as will be practicable and equitable.
(d) 
The  purchase price of each share of Common Stock acquired pursuant to a Participant’s Purchase Right willbe not less than the lesser of:
(i) 
an amount equal to 85% of such Participant’s Offering Date Price; or (ii) 
an  amount  equal  to  85%  of  the  Fair  Market  Value  of  a  share  of  Common  Stock  on  the  applicablePurchase Date.
7. 
PARTICIPATION; WITHDRAWAL; TERMINATION. (a) 
An  Eligible  Employee  may  elect  to  authorize  payroll  deductions  as  the  means  of  making  Contributions  bycompleting
 and  delivering  to  the  Company,  within  the  time  specified  in  the  Offering,  an  enrollment  form  provided  by  theCompany.
 The enrollment form will specify the amount of Contributions not to exceed the maximum amount specified by theBoard.
 Each Participant’s Contributions will be credited to a bookkeeping account for such Participant under the Plan and will bedeposited
 with the general funds of the Company except where applicable law requires that Contributions be deposited with athird party or otherwise
segregated.  If  permitted  in  the  Offering,  a  Participant  may  reduce  (including  to  zero)  or  increase  his  or  her  Contributions.  Ifrequired
 under  applicable  law  or  if  specifically  provided  in  the  Offering,  in  addition  to  or  instead  of  making  Contributions  bypayroll
 deductions,  a  Participant  may  make  Contributions  through  the  payment  by  cash  or  check  or  wire  transfer  prior  to  aPurchase Date, in the manner directed by the Company.
(b) 
During an  Offering, a Participant may cease making Contributions and withdraw from the Offering by deliveringto
 the Company a withdrawal form provided by the Company. The Company may impose a deadline before a Purchase Date forwithdrawing.
 Upon  such  withdrawal,  such  Participant’s  Purchase  Right  in  that  Offering  will  immediately  terminate  and  theCompany
 will distribute to such Participant all of his or her accumulated but unused Contributions. A Participant’s withdrawalfrom
 that  Offering  will  have  no  effect  upon  his  or  her  eligibility  to  participate  in  any  other  Offerings  under  the  Plan,  but  theParticipant will be required to deliver a new enrollment form to participate in future Offerings.
(c) 
Unless  otherwise required by applicable law, Purchase Rights granted pursuant to any Offering under the Planwill
 terminate immediately if the Participant either (i) is no longer an Employee for any reason or for no reason or (ii) is otherwiseno
 longer  eligible  to  participate.  The  Company  will  distribute  to  such  individual  all  of  his  or  her  accumulated  but  unusedContributions.
(d) 
During  a Participant’s lifetime, Purchase Rights will be exercisable only by such Participant. Purchase Rightsare not transferable by a
 Participant, except by will, by the laws of descent and distribution, or, if permitted by the Company, by abeneficiary designation as described in Section 10.
(e) 
The Company has no obligation to pay interest on Contributions, unless otherwise required by applicable law. 8. 
EXERCISE OF PURCHASE RIGHTS. (a) 
On  each  Purchase  Date,  each  Participant’s  accumulated  Contributions  will  be  applied  to  the  purchase  ofshares
 of Common Stock, up to the maximum number of shares of Common Stock permitted by the Plan and the applicableOffering,
 at the purchase price specified in the Offering. No fractional shares will be issued unless specifically provided for in theOffering.
(b) 
If  any amount of accumulated Contributions remains in a Participant’s account after the purchase of shares ofCommon
 Stock  on  the  final  Purchase  Date  of  an  Offering  and  such  remaining  amount  is  less  than  the  amount  required  topurchase
 one share of Common Stock, then such remaining amount will be held in such Participant’s account for the purchaseof
 shares of Common Stock under the next Offering under the Plan, unless such Participant withdraws from or is not eligible toparticipate
 in  such  Offering,  in  which  case  such  amount  will  be  distributed  to  such  Participant  after  the  final  Purchase  Date,without interest
 (unless otherwise required by applicable law). If the amount of Contributions remaining in a Participant’s accountafter the
 purchase of shares of Common Stock on the final Purchase Date of an Offering is at least equal to the amount requiredto
 purchase  one  whole  share  of  Common  Stock,  then  such  remaining  amount  will  not  roll  over  to  the  next  Offering  and  willinstead
 be  distributed  in  full  to  such  Participant  after  the  final  Purchase  Date,  without  interest  (unless  otherwise  required  byapplicable law).
(c) 
No  Purchase Rights may be exercised to any extent unless the shares of Common Stock to be issued uponsuch
 exercise under the Plan are covered by an effective registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act and the Plan is inmaterial
 compliance with all applicable laws. If on a Purchase Date the shares of Common Stock are not so registered or thePlan
 is not in such compliance, no Purchase Rights will be exercised on such Purchase Date, and the Purchase Date will bedelayed
 until the shares of Common Stock are subject to such an effective registration statement and the Plan is in materialcompliance,
 except that the Purchase Date will in no event be more than 27 months from the Offering Date. If, on the PurchaseDate,
 as delayed to the maximum extent permissible, the shares of Common Stock are not registered and the Plan is not inmaterial compliance with all applicable laws, no Purchase Rights will be exercised and all accumulated but unused
Contributions will be distributed to the Participants without interest (unless otherwise required under applicable local law).9. 
COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY. The
 Company  will  seek  to  obtain  from  each  federal,  state,  foreign  or  other  regulatory  commission  or  agency  havingjurisdiction
 over the Plan such authority as may be required to grant Purchase Rights and issue and sell shares of CommonStock
 thereunder unless doing so would be an unreasonable cost to the Company compared to the potential benefit to EligibleEmployees which the Company shall determine at its discretion. If, after commercially reasonable efforts, the Company is unable
to
 obtain the authority that counsel for the Company deems necessary for the grant of Purchase Rights or the lawful issuanceand
 sale  of  Common  Stock  under  the  Plan,  and  at  a  commercially  reasonable  cost,  the  Company  will  be  relieved  from  anyliability for failure to grant Purchase Rights and/or to issue and sell Common Stock upon exercise of such Purchase Rights.
10. 
DESIGNATION OF BENEFICIARY. (a) 
The  Company may, but is not obligated to, permit a Participant to submit a form designating a beneficiary whowill
 receive any shares of Common Stock and/or Contributions from the Participant’s account under the Plan if the Participantdies
 before such shares and/or Contributions are delivered to the Participant. The Company may, but is not obligated to, permitthe
 Participant to change such designation of beneficiary. Any such designation and/or change must be on a form approved bythe Company.
(b) 
If a  Participant dies, and in the absence of a valid beneficiary designation, the Company will deliver any sharesof
 Common  Stock  and/or  Contributions  to  the  executor  or  administrator  of  the  estate  of  the  Participant.  If  no  executor  oradministrator
 has been appointed (to the knowledge of the Company), the Company, in its sole discretion, may deliver suchshares
 of Common Stock and/or Contributions to the Participant’s spouse, dependents or relatives, or if no spouse, dependentor relative is known to the Company, then to such other person as the Company may designate.
11. 
ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN COMMON STOCK; CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS. (a) 
On  a Capitalization Adjustment, the Board will appropriately and proportionately adjust: (i) the class(es) andmaximum number of securities subject
 to the Plan pursuant to Section 3(a); (ii) the class(es) and number of securities subject to,and
 the purchase price applicable to outstanding Offerings and Purchase Rights; and (iii) the class(es) and number of securitiesthat
 are  the  subject  of  the  purchase  limits  under  each  ongoing  Offering.  The  Board  will  make  these  adjustments,  and  itsdetermination will be final, binding and conclusive.
(b) 
On  a Corporate Transaction, then: (i) any surviving corporation or acquiring corporation (or the surviving oracquiring
 corporation’s parent company) may assume or continue outstanding Purchase Rights or may substitute similar rights(including
 a  right  to  acquire  the  same  consideration  paid  to  the  stockholders  in  the  Corporate  Transaction)  for  outstandingPurchase
 Rights;  or  (ii)  if  any  surviving  or  acquiring  corporation  (or  its  parent  company) does  not  assume  or  continue  suchPurchase
 Rights or does not substitute similar rights for such Purchase Rights, then the Participants’ accumulated Contributionswill
 be  used  to  purchase  shares  of  Common  Stock  within  ten  business  days  prior  to  the  Corporate  Transaction  under  theoutstanding Purchase Rights, and the Purchase Rights will terminate immediately after such purchase.
12. 
AMENDMENT, TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF THE PLAN. (a) 
The Board  may amend the Plan at any time in any respect the Board deems necessary or advisable. However,except
 as  provided  in  Section  11(a)  relating  to  Capitalization  Adjustments,  stockholder  approval  will  be  required  for  anyamendment
 of  the  Plan  for  which  stockholder  approval  is  required  by  applicable  law  or  listing  requirements,  including  anyamendment
 that either (i) materially increases the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan, (ii)materially expands the class of individuals eligible
to become Participants and receive Purchase Rights, (iii) materially increases the benefits accruing to Participants under thePlan or materially
 reduces the price at which shares of Common Stock may be purchased under the Plan, (iv) materially extendsthe

Code
 and  the  regulations  and  other  interpretive  guidance  issued  thereunder  relating  to  Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plans)including
 without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued or amended after the Effective Date, or(iii)
 as  necessary  to  obtain  or  maintain  favorable  tax,  listing,  or  regulatory  treatment.  To  be  clear,  the  Board  may  amendoutstanding

Purchase  Rights granted under the 423 Component are intended to be exempt from the application of Section409A

 to U.S. taxpayers are intended to be exempt from the application of Section 409A of the Code under the short-termdeferral exception and any
 ambiguities will be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent. Subject to Section 13(b)hereof,
 Purchase Rights granted to U.S. taxpayers under the Non-423 Component will be subject to such terms and conditionsthat
 will permit such Purchase Rights to satisfy the requirements of the short-term deferral exception available under Section409A
 of  the  Code,  including  the  requirement  that  the  shares  subject  to  a  Purchase  Right  be  delivered  within  the  short-termdeferral
 period. Subject to Section 13(b) hereof, in the case of a Participant who would otherwise be subject to Section 409A ofthe
 Code, to the extent the Board determines that a Purchase Right or the exercise, payment, settlement or deferral thereof issubject to Section 409A of the Code, the Purchase Right will be granted, exercised, paid, settled or deferred in a manner that will
comply with Section 409A of the Code, including U.S. Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued
thereunder,
 including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the adoption of the Plan.Notwithstanding
 the foregoing, the Company will have no liability to a Participant or any other party if the Purchase Right that isintended
 to be exempt from or compliant with Section 409A of the Code is not so exempt or compliant or for any action taken bythe Board with respect thereto.
(b) 
Although the  Company may endeavor to (i) qualify a Purchase Right for favorable tax treatment under the lawsof
 the United States or jurisdictions outside of the United States or (ii) avoid adverse tax treatment (e.g., under Section 409A ofthe
 Code), the Company makes no representation to that effect and expressly disavows any covenant to maintain favorable oravoid
 unfavorable  tax  treatment,  notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  in  this  Plan,  including  Section  13(a)  hereof.  TheCompany
 will  be  unconstrained  in  its  corporate  activities  without  regard  to  the  potential  negative  tax  impact  on  Participantsunder the Plan.
14.

 Plan will become effective on the Effective Date. No Purchase Rights will be exercised unless and until the Plan hasbeen
 approved by the stockholders of the Company, which approval must be within 12 months before or after the date the Planis adopted (or if required under Section 12(a) above, materially amended) by the Board.
